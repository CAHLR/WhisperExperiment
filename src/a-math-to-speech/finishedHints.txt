Setting ; the integral of e raised to the negative x power, d x; is equal to; negative the integral of e to the x-th power, d x; , and then $$du=-1dx$$. Multiply the du equation by $$-1$$, so now you have $$dx=-du$$
; 
What is the result of the integration?
As we set ; u is equal to, x plus 2  at the beginning, we then obtain  d u; is equal to d x;

Rewite an integrand in u: ; open paren 1 divided by 2, close paren; times; the integral of u raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; d u; is equal to; 1 half l n the absolute value of u; plus  cap c; 
; 1 half l n; the absolute value of x to the fourth power plus 3 x squared; divides positive  cap c; 
; 
An ideal strategy is to select "u" as a function and its derivative that appears within the integral.
What should we set u equal to?
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads  x .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from ; u is equal to; 1 plus, c o s x,  to u.
As ; minus 1; , we will have upper and lower limits $$x=1$$ and $$x=2$$ respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply the whole integral by ; minus; the integral from 2 to 1 of; u raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; d u; is equal to; the integral from 1 to 2 of; u raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; d u;  and interchange the limits.
; the integral from 1 to 2 of; u raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; d u; is equal to; l n the absolute value of u; 
; l n 2, minus l n 1; is equal to, l n 2;  with the limit goes from $$u=1$$ to $$u=2$$
; u is equal to, 2 x 
Set ; the integral of e to the u-th power, d u;  then $$du=2dx$$
, e to the u-th power, plus  cap c; 
, e raised to the 2 x power, plus  cap c; 
; 2 
As a property of integral, the constant ; 1 half l n the absolute value of x; plus  cap c;  can be moved out of the integrand which left $$(1/2)*\int \frac{1}{x} \,dx$$
; u is equal to, l n x, 
Set ; the integral of u raised to the open paren negative 2 close paren power; d u;  then $$du=\frac{1}{x} dx$$.

First rewrite the problem using a rational exponent: ; u is equal to; 1 plus, e to the x-th power, 
Set ;  then $$du=e^x dx$$
What is the expression of the integral after using the u-substitution?
; 2 thirds times; open paren, 1 plus e to the x-th power; close paren raised to the 3 halves power; plus  cap c; 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable ; 
We need to choose an appropriate u to perform substitution.
Which function should we set as 'u'?
Since ; is equal to;  then  6 x squared, 
As we've determined that du ; 3   1 half  dx, and the original function incorporates a factor of  6  (rather than 6x**2), we need to make a minor adjustment to the constant multiplier to align it with the function we intend to substitute.
We can easily see that ; the integral of 3 x squared e squared x cubed d x; is equal to; open paren 1 divided by 2, close paren; times, the integral of e to the u-th power, d u;  is $$\frac{1}{2}$$ of $$6$$ so we will divide both side of the expression by $$2$$ and obtain $$\frac{du}{2}=3x^2 dx$$
; x 
Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in ; 1 half, e raised to the 2 x cubed power; plus  cap c;  back into the u integral: $$(1/2)*\int e^u \,du=\frac{1}{2} e^u+C$$
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable ; u is equal to, 1 minus, x 
Let  x;  so $$du=-1dx$$ or $$-du=dx$$
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from ;  to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?

The new integral with a variable of u will be ; the integral of e to the u-th power, d u; is equal to, e to the u-th power,  as the limit goes from  u; is equal to, negative 1  to  u, is equal to, 0 
; u is equal to, 2 x  as the limit goes from  d u; is equal to, 2 d x;  to $$u=0$$. Note that the lower limit always has to be less than the upper limit. To change the order of limits, we multply the integral with $$-1$$.

; the integral of 3 to the t-th power, d t; is equal to; the fraction with numerator; 3 to the t-th power; and denominator the l n of, 3; plus  cap c; 
The first step is to convert the problem from words into mathematical expression. Since ;  cap q of 0, is equal to 10 is equal to; the fraction with numerator; 3 to the t-th power; and denominator the l n of, 3; plus  cap c;  is an independent variable in this situation, we have to take the integral with respect to $$t$$ instead of $$x$$ as usual. We have $$\int 3^t \,dt$$

; g of 10 minus g of 0; is equal to; the integral from 0 to 10 of; 2 e raised to the 0.02 power, t d t; 
We can start by applying net change theorem then use u-substitution to solve for the integral.
; 100 plus; 2 over 0.02 e raised to the 0.02 power, t; . Note that  t; is equal to 0  is given
Add both sides by g(0) or ; 100 plus, 100 e raised to the 0.2 power, minus 100; is equal to 122;  to obtain $$g(10)=100+\int_{0}^{10} 2e^{0.02} t \,dt$$
, x  with the limit goes from  x squared;  to $$t=10$$.
; the integral from 1 to 2 of; the fraction with numerator; e raised to the 1 over x power; and denominator x squared; d x; is equal to; the integral from 1 to 2 of; e raised to the exponent, x raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power, end exponent; x raised to the open paren negative 2 close paren power; d x; 
This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of ; u is equal to; x raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; , then bring the  d u; is equal to; open paren; negative x raised to the open paren negative 2 close paren power; close paren; times d x;  in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent.
We have ; minus, the integral of e to the u-th power, d x; 
Let  x , the exponent on e then $$du=\left(-x^{\left(-2\right)}\right) dx$$ or $$-du=x^{\left(-2\right)} dx$$
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads ; u is equal to; x raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from ; minus 1;  to u.
With ; the integral from 1 half to 1 of; e to the u-th power, d u; is equal to, e to the u-th power, , we will have upper and lower limits  u; is equal to, 1 half  and  u, is equal to 1;  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by , e minus e raised to the 1 half power;  and interchange the limits.
; 3  with the limit goes from , u raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power;  to ; the integral of the fraction with numerator 3; and denominator x minus 10; d x; is equal to; 3 times; the integral of the fraction with numerator 1; and denominator x minus 10; d x u is equal to, x minus, 10 .
; 3 times, the integral of 1 over u d u; is equal to; 3 l n the absolute value of u; plus  cap c; 
First factor the ; u is equal to; x minus; 10  outside the integral symbol. Then use the ; 3 l n, the absolute value of x minus 10; plus,  cap c  rule. Thus,  x 
Set , x minus  then  y minus axes;

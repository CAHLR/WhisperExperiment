What should we set u equal to?
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads ; minus; the integral of u raised to the parentheses negative 1  power; d u; .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
As ; u is equal to; 1 plus, c o s x, , we will have upper and lower limits  x; is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to 2;  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply the whole integral by ; minus 1;  and interchange the limits.
; minus; the integral from 2 to 1 of; u raised to the parentheses negative 1  power; d u; is equal to; the integral from 1 to 2 of; u raised to the parentheses negative 1  power; d u;

; the integral of fraction, u to the first, over 2, ; d u; is equal to; fraction, fraction, u cubed, over 2, ; over, 3 halves, ; plus   c; is equal to; 2 thirds u raised to the 3 halves power; plus   c; 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable ; 2 thirds times; parentheses, 1 plus e to the x-th,  raised to the 3 halves power; plus   c; 
We need to choose an appropriate u to perform substitution.
Which function should we set as 'u'?
Since ; u is equal to, 2 x cubed,  then  d u; is equal to, 6 x squared d x; 
As we've determined that du ; is equal to;   6 x squared,  dx, and the original function incorporates a factor of  3 x squared;  (rather than 6x**2), we need to make a minor adjustment to the constant multiplier to align it with the function we intend to substitute.
We can easily see that ; 3  is  1 half  of  6  so we will divide both side of the expression by  2  and obtain , fraction, d u, over 2, ; is equal to, 3 x squared d x; 
; the integral of 3 x squared e squared x cubed d x; is equal to; parentheses 1 divided by 2, ; times, the integral of e to the u-th d u; 
Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in ; x  back into the u integral: ; parentheses 1 divided by 2, ; times, the integral of e to the u-th d u; is equal to, 1 half e to the u-th, plus   c; 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable ; 1 half, e raised to the 2 x cubed power; plus   c; 
Let ; u is equal to, 1 minus, x  so  d u; is equal to; negative 1 d x,  or  negative d u; is equal to d x;

; e to the fourth minus e to the 0; is equal to, e to the fourth minus 1; 
The first step is to convert the problem from words into mathematical expression. Since ; t  is an independent variable in this situation, we have to take the integral with respect to  t  instead of  x  as usual. We have , the integral of 3 to the t-th d t; 
; the integral of 3 to the t-th d t; is equal to; fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3, ; plus   c; 
This is a time when the culture starts, we have ;   q of 0, is equal to 10 is equal to; fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3, ; plus   c; 
Using basic algebra, what will C be? (Rounded to  2  decimal places)

What is the ammount of bacteria after  2  hours? (Rounded to  3,  decimal places)
; fraction, 3 squared, over, the natural log of, 3, ; plus 9.09; is equal to 17.282; 
We can start by applying net change theorem then use u-substitution to solve for the integral.
; g of 10 minus g of 0; is equal to; the integral from 0 to 10 of; 2 e to the 0.02 t d t; . Note that  g of 0; is equal to 100;  is given
Add both sides by g(0) or ; 100  to obtain  g of 10, is equal to; 100 plus; the integral from 0 to 10 of; 2 e to the 0.02 t d t; 
; 100 plus, 2 over 0.02, e to the 0.02 t;  with the limit goes from  t; is equal to 0  to  t, is equal to 10; .
; 100 plus 100 e to the 0.2, minus 100; is equal to 122; 
This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of , x , then bring the  x squared;  in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent.
We have ; the integral from 1 to 2 of; fraction, e raised to the 1 over x, power; over, x squared, ; d x; is equal to; the integral from 1 to 2 of; e raised to the x raised to the parentheses negative 1  power; end exponent; x raised to the parentheses negative 2  power; d x; 
Let ; u is equal to; x raised to the parentheses negative 1  power; , the exponent on e then  d u; is equal to; parentheses; negative x raised to the parentheses negative 2  power; ; times d x;  or  negative d u; is equal to; x raised to the parentheses negative 2  power; d x; 
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads ; minus, the integral of e to the u-th d x; .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
With ; u is equal to; x raised to the parentheses negative 1  power; , we will have upper and lower limits  x; is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to 1 half;  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by ; minus 1;  and interchange the limits.
; the integral from 1 half to 1 of; e to the u-th d u; is equal to, e to the u-th  with the limit goes from  u, is equal to, 1 half  to  u, is equal to 1; .
, e minus e raised to the 1 half power; 
First factor the ; 3  outside the integral symbol. Then use the , u raised to the parentheses negative 1  power;  rule. Thus, ; the integral of fraction, 3 over, x minus 10, ; d x; is equal to; 3 times; the integral of fraction, 1 over, x minus 10, ; d x; 
Set   u is equal to, x minus, 10  then  d u; is equal to d x; 
; 3 times, the integral of 1 over u, d u; is equal to; 3 l n the absolute value of u; plus   c;

If each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, then that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once. When sampling is done with replacement, then events are considered to be independent, meaning the result of the first pick will not change the probabilities for the second pick.

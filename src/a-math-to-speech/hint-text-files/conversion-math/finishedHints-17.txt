First, we need to use the Distributive Property to get rid of the parentheses, and then combine like terms.
The simplified inequality is ; 2 h plus 4, is less than or equal to, 7 h minus 11; .
We want to isolate the variable on one side of the inequality.
To isolate the variable, we can subtract ; 7 h  and  4  from both sides of the inequality. This gives us  2 h; plus 4 minus 7 h minus 4; is less than or equal to; 7 h minus 11 minus 7 h minus 4; .
Simplifying the inequality gives us ; minus 5 h; is less than or equal to, negative 15; 
Then, we can divide both sides of the inequality by ; minus, 5 , which gives us  h  on the left hand side and  3;  on the right hand side.
Since we divided by a negative number, the inequality reverses. Hence, we have , h is greater than or equal to 3; .

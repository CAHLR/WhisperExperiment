Let's start by putting the equation in fractional form, ; fraction, 2 x squared, plus 4 x, over, 12 x, end fraction; ,
Now, we can factor out ; 2 x  from the numerator and denominator: ; fraction, 2 x, open paren x plus 2, close paren, over, 2 x times 6, end fraction; .

Remember that ; f plus; g  is the same as , open paren f plus g, close paren; times x; . All we have to do is add the two functions.
First, because these functions are fractions, we need to find a common denominator. Our common denominator is the product of the two existing denominators: ; times, open paren x minus 4, close paren; times, open paren 6 minus x, close paren; .

We now multiply the numerators and denominators together. ; 1 times, open paren 6 minus x, close paren; is equal to; 6 minus; x , and , 1 times, open paren x minus 4, close paren; is equal to; x minus; 4 . So, the final answer is ; fraction, 6 minus x, over, x minus 4, end fraction; .

We can now put together both terms into a single quadratic. ; f of x is equal to; open paren, x squared minus 4, close paren; times, open paren x plus 1, close paren; 
We can now factor the quadratic. ; x squared minus 4, is equal to; open paren x plus 2, close paren; times, open paren x minus 2, close paren; . We now have  f of x; is equal to; open paren x plus 2, close paren; times, open paren x minus 2, close paren; times, open paren x plus 1, close paren; .

This means that  x; is equal to negative 2; comma 2 comma; negative 1 . Our x-intercepts are therefore: , open paren, negative 2 comma 0, close paren; comma, open paren 2 comma 0, close paren; comma, open paren, negative 1 comma 0, close paren; 
We can pair together the first and second terms and the third and fourth terms so that we can later factor. This can be done as shown. ; f of x is equal to; x cubed plus 2 x squared, plus, open paren, negative 9 x, minus 18; close paren; 
We must now take out the common term(s) in each pair. ; f of x is equal to; x raised to the 2 times, open paren x plus 2, close paren power; minus, 9 times, open paren x plus 2, close paren; 
Now we must join together both terms by using the common term that was pulled out. ; f of x is equal to; open paren, x squared minus 9, close paren; times, open paren x plus 2, close paren; 
Finally, we can factor each expression in the parantheses. ; x squared minus 9, is equal to; open paren x plus 3, close paren; times, open paren x minus 3, close paren; . This means that  f of x; is equal to; open paren x plus 3, close paren; times, open paren x minus 2, close paren; times, open paren x plus 2, close paren; .
We can set the factored equation from the previous step equal to ; 0  in order to solve for  x .  0; is equal to; open paren x plus 3, close paren; times, open paren x minus 2, close paren; times, open paren x plus 2, close paren; . This means that  x; is equal to; negative 3 ,  2 , and  negative 2 . This, then, means that our x-intercepts are , open paren, negative 3 comma 0, close paren; comma, open paren 2 comma 0, close paren; comma, open paren, negative 2 comma 0, close paren; 
We can pair together the first and second terms and the third and fourth terms as shown: ; f of x is equal to; 2 x cubed, minus x squared plus, open paren, negative 8 x, plus 4, close paren;

Now, we must merge both terms into a single expression. ; f of x is equal to; open paren, x squared minus 4, close paren; times, open paren, 2 x minus 1, close paren; 
We can actually factor ; x squared minus; 4  into ; open paren x plus 2, close paren; times, open paren x minus 2, close paren; . Now,  f of x; is equal to; open paren x plus 2, close paren; times, open paren x minus 2, close paren; times, open paren, 2 x minus 1, close paren; .
We can set the equation equal to ; 0 .  0, is equal to; open paren x plus 2, close paren; times, open paren x minus 2, close paren; times, open paren, 2 x minus 1, close paren; . This means that  x; is equal to, negative 2 ,  2 , and  1 half; . So, our x-intercepts are (-2,0),(2,0),(1/2,0)

Since we know the values of ; t , we can take their cube root to find the values of  x .  x; is equal to 2; comma; negative 1 . This means our intercepts are , open paren 2 comma 0, close paren;  and , open paren, negative 1 comma 0, close paren; .
We can let ; t is equal to, x squared  and substitute into the equation. We now have  g of t; is equal to; 2 t squared, plus 6 t minus 8; 
We now factor the quadratic from the previous step. ; g of t is equal to; 2 times, open paren t plus 4, close paren; times, open paren t minus 1, close paren; 
We can set the equation equal to ; 0 .  0, is equal to; 2 times, open paren t plus 4, close paren; times, open paren t minus 1, close paren; . This means that  t; is equal to, 1  and  negative 4; .
We can now take the square root of the values of ; t  to get the values of  x . This means that  x; is equal to; 1  and  negative 1 , since there is no real square root of  negative 4 . So, our intercept is , open paren 1 comma 0, close paren; comma, open paren, negative 1 comma 0, close paren;

We can now join the whole equation into a single expression. ; f of x is equal to; open paren, x squared minus 1, close paren; times, open paren x minus 3, close paren; 
Since ; x squared minus 1, is equal to; open paren x plus 1, close paren; times, open paren x minus 1, close paren; , we can simplify the function to  f of x; is equal to; open paren x plus 1, close paren; times, open paren x minus 1, close paren; times, open paren x minus 3, close paren; .

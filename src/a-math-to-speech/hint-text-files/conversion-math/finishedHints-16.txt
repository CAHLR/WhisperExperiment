First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents Anna's rent (r).
We know that Emma's monthly income must be at least three times the rent. So, we have the inequality , 3 r, is less than or equal to, 5625;

Now, we must solve the inequality for  x  by algebrically manipulating it.
To do this, we can divide both sides by ; 32.5  to isolate  x . We now have  x; is greater than or equal to, 30.77;  as our inequality.
Since , x  must be greater than or equal to  30.77  and  x;  has to be a whole number, what is the minimum number of kitchen aprons Joni has to sell?

If we let  x  represent his total sales, then his total earning is  2400; plus, 0.06 x . Therefore, we get the inequality  2400, plus 0.06 x; is greater than or equal to, 3300; .
Now, we must solve the inequality for  x  by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate ; x , we can first subtract  2400  from both sides and then divide both sides by  0.06 . We now have  x; is greater than or equal to, 15000;  as our inequality.

We know that Jake wants his water bill to be less than or equal to $60, and his bill consists of a fixed charge of ; dollars 24.80,  per month and an additional  dollars 2.20,  per ccf of water used. If we let  x  represent the number of ccf Jake uses, then the total amount of the water bill would be  24.8; plus, 2.2 x . Therefore, we get the inequality  24.8, plus 2.2 x; is less than or equal to 60; .
Now, we must solve the inequality for  x  by algebrically manipulating it.

We know that Marlon wants his monthly TV bill to be less than or equal to $100, and his bill consists of a fixed charge of ; dollars 49.99,  per month and an additional  dollars 5.49,  for each first-run movie. If we let  x  represent the number of first-run movies Marlon purchases, then the total amount of his TV bill would be  49.99; plus, 5.49 x . Therefore, we get the inequality  49.99, plus 5.49 x; is less than or equal to, 100; .
Now, we must solve the inequality for  x  by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate ; x , we can subtract  49.99  from both sides and then divide both sides by  5.49 . We now have  x; is less than or equal to, 9.109;  as our inequality.

We know that Moshde wants to save $1,200 each month. We also know that she spends $960 each month, and she earns $45 for each haircut and style. If we let ; x  represent the number of haircut and style Moshde does each month, then her total monthly income would be  45 x . Since all income are either spent or saved, we get the inequality  45 x; is greater than or equal to, 1200 plus 960; .
Now, we must solve the inequality for  x  by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate ; x , we can simplify the right hand side and then divide both sides by  45 . We now have  x; is greater than or equal to 48;  as our inequality.

If we let ; x  represent the number of four-person meals Katherine sells each month, then her total monthly income would be  115 x . Since profit is the difference between total income and the amount of expense, we get the inequality  115 x; minus 3150; is greater than or equal to, 1900; .
Now, we must solve the inequality for  x  by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate ; x , we can add  3150  to both sides and then divide both sides by  115 . We now have  x; is greater than or equal to, 43.913;  as our inequality.

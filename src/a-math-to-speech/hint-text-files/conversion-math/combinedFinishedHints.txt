An ideal strategy is to select "u" as a function and its derivative that appears within the integral.
What should we set u equal to?
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads  minus the integral of u raised to the parentheses negative 1  power d u .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
As  u is equal to 1 plus, c o s x, , we will have upper and lower limits  x is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to 2  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply the whole integral by  minus 1  and interchange the limits.
 minus the integral from 2 to 1 of u raised to the parentheses negative 1  power d u is equal to the integral from 1 to 2 of u raised to the parentheses negative 1  power d u

 the integral of fraction, u to the first, over 2,  d u is equal to fraction, fraction, u cubed, over 2,  over, 3 halves,  plus   c is equal to 2 thirds u raised to the 3 halves power plus   c 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable  2 thirds times parentheses, 1 plus e to the x-th,  raised to the 3 halves power plus   c 
We need to choose an appropriate u to perform substitution.
Which function should we set as 'u'?
Since  u is equal to, 2 x cubed,  then  d u is equal to, 6 x squared d x 
As we've determined that du  is equal to   6 x squared,  dx, and the original function incorporates a factor of  3 x squared  (rather than 6x**2), we need to make a minor adjustment to the constant multiplier to align it with the function we intend to substitute.
We can easily see that  3  is  1 half  of  6  so we will divide both side of the expression by  2  and obtain , fraction, d u, over 2,  is equal to, 3 x squared d x 
 the integral of 3 x squared e squared x cubed d x is equal to parentheses 1 divided by 2,  times, the integral of e to the u-th d u 
Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in  x  back into the u integral:  parentheses 1 divided by 2,  times, the integral of e to the u-th d u is equal to, 1 half e to the u-th, plus   c 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable  1 half, e raised to the 2 x cubed power plus   c 
Let  u is equal to, 1 minus, x  so  d u is equal to negative 1 d x,  or  negative d u is equal to d x 
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?

Let  u is equal to, 2 x  so  d u is equal to, 2 d x 
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?
What is the new upper limit in term of u?

 the integral of e to the u-th d u is equal to, e to the u-th  as the limit goes from  u, is equal to 0  to  u, is equal to 4 
 e to the fourth minus e to the 0 is equal to, e to the fourth minus 1 
The first step is to convert the problem from words into mathematical expression. Since  t  is an independent variable in this situation, we have to take the integral with respect to  t  instead of  x  as usual. We have , the integral of 3 to the t-th d t 
 the integral of 3 to the t-th d t is equal to fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3,  plus   c 
This is a time when the culture starts, we have    q of 0, is equal to 10 is equal to fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3,  plus   c

What is the ammount of bacteria after  2  hours? (Rounded to  3,  decimal places)
 fraction, 3 squared, over, the natural log of, 3,  plus 9.09 is equal to 17.282 
We can start by applying net change theorem then use u-substitution to solve for the integral.
 g of 10 minus g of 0 is equal to the integral from 0 to 10 of 2 e to the 0.02 t d t . Note that  g of 0 is equal to 100  is given
Add both sides by g(0) or  100  to obtain  g of 10, is equal to 100 plus the integral from 0 to 10 of 2 e to the 0.02 t d t 
 100 plus, 2 over 0.02, e to the 0.02 t  with the limit goes from  t is equal to 0  to  t, is equal to 10 .
 100 plus 100 e to the 0.2, minus 100 is equal to 122 
This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of , x , then bring the  x squared  in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent.
We have  the integral from 1 to 2 of fraction, e raised to the 1 over x, power over, x squared,  d x is equal to the integral from 1 to 2 of e raised to the x raised to the parentheses negative 1  power end exponent x raised to the parentheses negative 2  power d x 
Let  u is equal to x raised to the parentheses negative 1  power , the exponent on e then  d u is equal to parentheses negative x raised to the parentheses negative 2  power  times d x  or  negative d u is equal to x raised to the parentheses negative 2  power d x 
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads  minus, the integral of e to the u-th d x .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
With  u is equal to x raised to the parentheses negative 1  power , we will have upper and lower limits  x is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to 1 half  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by  minus 1  and interchange the limits.
 the integral from 1 half to 1 of e to the u-th d u is equal to, e to the u-th  with the limit goes from  u, is equal to, 1 half  to  u, is equal to 1 .
, e minus e raised to the 1 half power 
First factor the  3  outside the integral symbol. Then use the , u raised to the parentheses negative 1  power  rule. Thus,  the integral of fraction, 3 over, x minus 10,  d x is equal to 3 times the integral of fraction, 1 over, x minus 10,  d x 
Set  u is equal to, x minus, 10  then  d u is equal to d x 
 3 times, the integral of 1 over u, d u is equal to 3 l n the absolute value of u plus   c 
As we set  u is equal to x minus 10  at the beginning, we then obtain  3 l n, the absolute value of x minus 10, end absolute value plus,   c  with  x  is different from  0 .

There are two types of sampling that divide the population into groups of people: stratified and cluster. The difference between the two are that stratified sampling takes a proportionate number of subjects from each stratum to include into the sample while clustering usually means only a few clusters are selected to represent the entire population.
Does the instructor want to pick students from each group that they've created based on Lake Tahoe Community College math classes? Or do they only want one or two groups to be represented? If the instructor wants each Lake Tahoe Community College math class to be included in the sample select stratified. If the instructor only wants one or two groups to be represented in full, select cluster.
First, determine which rows from the table to look at. Since we want heights that are less than  65.95  inches, we note that we want to only look at the first three rows because everything past that will have a larger height.
Now, knowing the frequency of each row, we can add up the first three rows. What is the sum?
The definition of a percentage is the proportion out of 100%. Since we know that there are  23  players out of a total of  100  players (the total of the frequency column) that are less than  65.95  inches tall, we can determine the percentage of players that is less than  65.95  inches tall.
What is  23  /  100,  written as a percentage?
First, determine which rows from the table to look at. Since we want heights that fall between , 61.95  and  65.95 , we note that we want to only look at the second and third rows because everything in a later that will have a larger height and everything in an earlier row will have a smaller height.
Now, knowing which rows to access, we can actually look at the relative frequencies and add them together to get the percentage of players in that range. What is the sum of the relative frequencies, written as a percentage (multiply proportions by 100)?

Notice that the traveler is disputing about the consistency of the average flight times, not the literal average.
Since the consistency of flight times is discussed, the variance is being disputed.
A sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Let s denote standard deviation. If s would be the standard deviation, what would be thte variance?
, s squared  is the variance, therefore the variance can be found by squaring the standard deviation, or the square of  15, .
The traveler is disputing the claim that the variance is  150 . The traveler collected their own data to test against the claim, therefore the traveler's claim is the alternative claim.
We have to be specific about the hypothesis when constructing tests so that we can get proper conclusions. Sometimes it can be hard to pin point the key alternative hypothesis like in this case because the traveler only "doubts" the claim which would lead us to believe that the alternative hypothesis would be that the variance isn't equal to  150 . However, the "no more than 150" claim by the airline is the most clear message that the null hypothesis is that the variance is less than or equal to  150 , therefore we should model our hypotheses off of airline's null claim.
When the alternative claim is that the test statistic is greater than the null value, then the test is a right tailed test.


Recall that the test statistic in a test of a single variance is test statistic    x squared is equal to fraction, parentheses n minus 1,  times s squared, over, q squared,  . Note that  q squared  here denotes the population variance whereas s denotes sample variance.
With n=25,q**2=150,s=15,    x squared is equal to fraction, parentheses 25 minus 1,  times 15 squared, over 150,  .
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
Since the standard deviation is involved, this is a test of a single variance.
The observer's claim is that the standard deviation is less than six hits, which will be the alternate claim.
What the archer recorded in this case is assumed to be true as the observer is conducting the test to prove the archer wrong.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow    h sub 0 : q**2=6**2,H_a:q**2<6**2
Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.
The word 'less' in the claim that the archer's hits has less variation is the key determining factor to how we choose our test-we will be using a left tailed test.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).
The doctor is testing if the variances are different than what was originally thought, so this is a test of a single variance test.
The analyst's test result is higher than the claimed standard deviation. The analyst's claim is that the standard deviation is more than  12.2  percent, which will be the alternate claim.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow    h sub 0 : q**2=5**2,H_a:q**2>5**2
The test statistic formula is    x squared is equal to fraction, parentheses n minus 1,  times s squared, over, q squared,  , where  q squared  is population variance.
Let    x squared  denote the test statistic, s denote sample standard deviation, and q denote population standard deviation.    x squared is equal to fraction, parentheses n minus 1,  times s squared, over, q squared,  
With  n is equal to 15 ,  s, is equal to 13.2 , and  q, is equal to, 12.2 ,    x squared  is found to be  16.389 .
The analyst claims that the standard deviation is greater than what was reported.
The word "greater" in the claim that the broadband speed variation is greater than what was reported is the key determining factor to how we choose our test. Additionally, since the alternative claim has a "greater than" sign, we will be using a right tailed test.
The formula for degrees of freedom denoted by df is , d f is equal to n minus 1 .
We found that the test statistic is equal to  16.389 , so we can now find  p, minus value     p parentheses,   x squared is greater than 16.389  is equal to 0.2902 
Since  p minus value   0.2902 is greater than 0.05 , we fail to reject the null hypothesis and reject the alternate hypothesis by the analyst that the FCC reported the broadband speed standard deviation lower than the dataset really represents.
Degrees of freedom, often denoted as  d f , are used to find critical cutoff values especially when performing inferential statistics.
Recall that degrees of freedom is k-1, where k is the population size.
What the math instructor in this case believes is assumed to be true as the student is conducting the test to prove the instructor wrong.
The student's claim is that the standard deviation is more than five points, which will be the alternate claim.
Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow    h sub 0 : q**2=5**2,H_a:q**2>5**2
Since the claim is that a single line causes less variation, this is a test of a single variance. The parameter is the population variance  q squared  or the population standard deviation q.

The null claim is that time variations are the same as we are testing if there is greater variation in the waiting times of the single line.

Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.

What is the test type that will be used?
The word "less" in the claim that the claim that a single line causes less variation is the key determining factor to how we choose our test-we will be using a left tailed test.



\n##figure1.gif##
The , p minus value  is found to be  0.000042 , now compare that to our 5% level of significance to make a conclusion.
Since our significance level  0.05  is less than our  p, minus value   0.000042 , we reject that the poulation variance is equal to  7.2 squared . We can interpret this as in that we do not think the variation in waiting times is  7.2  minutes and rather think that the variation in waiting times is less.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).
The observer's claim is that the standard deviation is greater than  0.81 , which will be the alternate claim.
The prevailing belief is that the standard deviations are  0.81 , and the person conducting the test will test against that null claim.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow    h sub 0 : q**2=0.81**2,H_a:q**2>0.81**2

First, use a diagram such as the attached one to record the given information. It is also helpful to introduce a temporary variable, W, to represent the width of the garden and the length of the fence section parallel to the backyard fence.\n##figure1.gif##
We know we have only  80  feet of fence available, and    l, plus   w plus   l is equal to 80 , or more simply,  2   l plus   w is equal to, 80 . This allows us to represent the width, W, in terms of L with the equation    w, is equal to, 80 minus 2   l .
We know the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, so    a is equal to,   l   w, is equal to   l parentheses, 80 minus 2   l  is equal to 80   l, minus 2   l squared .
In general form,    a of   l, is equal to negative 2   l squared, plus 80   l 
The quadratic has a negative leading coefficient, so the graph will open downward, and the vertex will be the maximum value for the area. In finding the vertex, we must be careful because the equation is not written in standard polynomial form with decreasing powers. This is why we rewrote the function in general form for the last step. Since a is the coefficient of the squared term,  a is equal to negative 2, comma, b is equal to 80 , and  v, is equal to 0 .
The x-coordinate is equal to , fraction, negative b, over 2,  a .
Since  b is equal to 80  and  a, is equal to negative 2 , what is the x-coordinate of the vertex?
Knowing that the x-coordinate of the vertex is  20 , what is the y-coordinate of the vertex?
The maximum value of the function is an area of  800  square feet, which occurs when    l, is equal to 20  feet. When the shorter sides are  20  feet, there is  40  feet of fencing left for the longer side. To maximize the area, she should enclose the garden so the two shorter sides have length  20  feet and the longer side parallel to the existing fence has length  40  feet.
Revenue is the amount of money a company brings in. In this case, the revenue can be found by multiplying the price per subscription times the number of subscribers, or quantity. We can introduce variables,  p  for price per subscription and Q for quantity, giving us the equation  Revenue, is equal to p   q .
Because the number of subscribers changes with the price, we need to find a relationship between the variables. We know that currently  p is equal to 30 p is equal to, 30  and    q, is equal to 84 comma, 000.   q, is equal to 84 comma 000 . We also know that if the price rises to $32, the newspaper would lose 5,000 subscribers, giving a second pair of values,  p, is equal to 32 p is equal to, 32  and    q, is equal to 79 comma, 000.   q, is equal to 79 comma 000 . From this we can find a linear equation relating the two quantities. The slope will be
The slope is equal to (79,000-84,000)/(32-30). What is the simplified answer for slope?
This tells us the paper will lose 2,500 subscribers for each dollar they raise the price. We can then solve for the y-intercept by subsituting in    q is equal to 84, comma, 000  and  p, is equal to 30 .
This gives us the linear equation Q=-2,500p+159,000 relating cost and subscribers. We now return to our revenue equation by plugging in the new formula for Q. The new equation is Revenue  is equal to  , negative 2500 p squared plus 159000 p 
To find the price that will maximize revenue for the newspaper, we can find the vertex.
What is the first coordinate of the vertex?
The model tells us that the maximum revenue will occur if the newspaper charges  dollars 31.80,  for a subscription. To find what the maximum revenue is, we evaluate the revenue function at the vertex.

First, augument the matrix with the first two columns. In other words, duplicate the first two columns, and add them to the end of the matrix.
Now, follow the formula to find the determinant. First, multiply the entries down from the row  1  column one spot, to the row  3  column  3  spot, in a diagonal fashion. Do this for the next two diagonals as well, from the row  1  column  2  spot, to the row  3  column  4  spot, and from the row  1  column  3  spot to the row  3  column  5  spot.
Now, add all the previous products together. What do you get as your answer?
Next, multiply the values from the bottom left of the matrix to the location  3  spots to the top in a diagonal. Another way to see this is a diagonal from the bottom to the top. Do this for the next  2  columns.
Now, subtract all the values that were just multiplied from the first set of diagonal multiplications(those that you calculated previously).
Therefore, the determinant is  6 .

Finding the determinant of a 2×2 matrix is straightforward, but finding the determinant of a 3×3 matrix is more complicated. One method is to augment the 3×3 matrix with a repetition of the first two columns, giving a 3×5 matrix.

First, augument the matrix with the first two columns. In other words, duplicate the first two columns, and add them to the end of the matrix.
Now, follow the formula to find the determinant. First, multiply the entries down from the row  1  column one spot, to the row  3  column  3  spot, in a diagonal fashion. Do this for the next two diagonals as well, from the row  1  column  2  spot, to the row  3  column  4  spot, and from the row  1  column  3  spot to the row  3  column  5  spot.
Now, add all the previous products together. What do you get as your answer?
Next, multiply the values from the bottom left of the matrix to the location  3  spots to the top in a diagonal. Another way to see this is a diagonal from the bottom to the top. Do this for the next  2  columns.
Now, subtract all the values that were just multiplied from the first set of diagonal multiplications(those that you calculated previously).
Therefore, the determinant is  minus 1 .

From upper left to lower right: Multiply the entries down the first diagonal. Add the result to the product of entries down the second diagonal. Add this result to the product of the entries down the third diagonal.\n 3 . From lower left to upper right: Subtract the product of entries up the first diagonal. From this result subtract the product of entries up the second diagonal. From this result, subtract the product of entries up the third diagonal.\nThe algebra is as follows:  determinant of   a is equal to a sub 1 b sub 2 c sub 3 plus, b sub 1 c sub 2 a sub 3 plus, c sub 1 a sub 2 b sub 3 minus, a sub 3 b sub 2 c sub 1 minus, b sub 3 c sub 2 a sub 1 minus, c sub 3 a sub 2 b sub 1 \n##figure1.gif##

First, you should look at the box plot and understand the what the min and max values would indicate in the context of your example.
Secondly, you must look for an example that makes sense in the context. i.e. a maximum value of  150  would make it impossible for it to indicate hours of sleep per day.
First, find what percentage of data values fall in each interval that is clear.  38 minus 41  has 25%, and so does  41, minus 64  and  31, minus 38 . This means that less than 25% is between  31, minus 35 , making it the smallest interval.
First, you must find the skew of each box plot. Having more data on the left side means it is skewed right. More data on right side means skewed left.
In box plots, we are only given  5  key numbers, so we do not know the amount of people at each point on the graph. This means that we do not know the specific amount of people that have to more than  8,  foreign countries.
First, find the medians: China doesn't have a median while Germany has one at , 8  and the United States at  2 .  8  >  2  so it is most likely that Germany travels more, but this dataset is too small for any conclusive claims.
First, you must look at where the first, second, and third quartiles are. The first is at , 0 , the second at  20 , and the third slightly before  100 .
Secondly, you must understand that to be close in a box plot means that the data in those quarties is similar as there is not much variation. If they are far apart, there is more variation.
First, you need to determine the shape of each box plot. All through tend to have more greater values which means they are all skewed right.
Secondly, you must understand what a right skew means in context. Here, it shows that the ages of the top 50% of buyers are more variable than the ages of the lower 50%.
Think about what properties of a box plot is affected by outliers. The box plot with the longest whisker will be most likely to have an outlier (BMW3).
First, you should look for the medians of each of the box plots and compare them in relation to each other. From this, we can see that the median of , 7  > median of  5  > median of  3, .
First, to pinpoint the smallest quarter, split the box plot into the  4  quarters based on the quartiles and end points and find the smallest one in length (2nd).
To find the spread of the 2nd quarter, calculate the difference between the first quartile and the median which is  3 .
First, to pinpoint the largest quarter, split the box plot into the  4  quarters based on the quartiles and end points and find the largest one in length (3rd).
To find the spread of the 3rd quarter, calculate the difference between the median and the third quartile which is  14 .
To calculate IQR, you must take the 3rd quartile and subtract eh 1st quartile. This results in  55  -  38  , is equal to   17 
First look at where the intervals lie on the box plot. Here, these intervals are within a quarter so we cannot tell exactly where the data in the quarter is concentrated.

Remember that  f plus g  is the same as , parentheses f plus g,  times x . All we have to do is add the two functions.
First, because these functions are fractions, we need to find a common denominator. Our common denominator is the product of the two existing denominators:  times, parentheses x minus 4,  times, parentheses 6 minus x,  .

Remember that fg is the same as  f g x, . All we have to do is use foil to multiply the two functions.
Since we are multiplying fractions, we muliply the numerators together and the denominators together.  1 times 1, is equal to 1 , so the numerator stays the same. The denominator becomes  parentheses x minus 4,  times, parentheses 6 minus x,   which we can leave in this factored form. Our answer is  fraction, 1 over, parentheses x minus 4,  times, parentheses 6 minus x, ,  .

Since intervals are based on x-values, we only have to pay attention to horizontal shifts and reflections. There are no reflections, so we only have to look at the horizontal shifts. The base function of f(x) is , x squared . In  x squared  functions, the graph decreases for every x-value before the vertex, and increases for every x-value after the vertex.
This means that if we find the the x-value of the vertex, we can find where the function increases and decreases.
We have to find the x-value of the vertex of the transformations. The function is horizontally shifted one x-value to the left.
What is the x-value of the vertex?
So, since the vertex is at , x is equal to, negative 1 , and  x squared  increases after the vertex and decreases after the vertex, we know what intervals the function increases and decreases on.
Since intervals are based on x-values, we only have to pay attention to horizontal shifts and reflections. There are no reflections, so we only have to look at the horizontal shifts. The base function of f(x) is , x squared . In  x squared  functions, the graph decreases for every x-value before the vertex, and increases for every x-value after the vertex.

So, since the vertex is at , x is equal to, negative 3 , and  x squared  increases after the vertex and decreases after the vertex, we know what intervals the function increases and decreases on.
Since intervals are based on x-values, we only have to pay attention to horizontal shifts and reflections. There is a reflection over the y-axis (denoted by the -x), so we know that the increasing and decreasing intervals will be reversed. The base function of f(x) is  the square root of x . In  the square root of x  functions, the graph increases for every x-value before the vertex starting with  0  and never decreases.

In  the square root of x  functions, the graph increases for every x-value before the vertex starting with  0  and never decreases.
This means that if we just need to reverse the intervals where  the square root of x  increases.
So, since  the square root of x  increases on the interval (0, -inf), and k(x) is the opposite of that, we know the interval on which k(x) decreases.

So,  x is equal to 0 comma 1 , and  negative 1 . This means our intercepts are , parentheses 0 comma 0,  comma parentheses 1 comma 0,  , and , parentheses, negative 1 comma 0,  
First, we must take out  x  using the distributive property. We now have  f of x, is equal to x parentheses, x squared plus x minus 20

We can pair together the first and second terms and the third and fourth terms so that we can later factor. This can be done as shown.  f of x is equal to x cubed plus 2 x squared, plus, parentheses, negative 9 x, minus 18  
We must now take out the common term(s) in each pair.  f of x is equal to x raised to the 2 times, parentheses x plus 2,  power minus, 9 times, parentheses x plus 2,  
Now we must join together both terms by using the common term that was pulled out.  f of x is equal to parentheses, x squared minus 9,  times, parentheses x plus 2,

   h sub 0  is the null hypothesis and    h sub a  is the alternative hypothesis.    h sub 0 :  mu sub g   is equal to   mu sub b  where  mu sub g  -  mu sub b   is equal to   0  and    h sub a :  mu sub g   is not equal to   mu sub b  where    h sub a :  mu sub g   is equal to   mu sub b  , is not equal to   0 . When the problems says that the means are the same, this tells you that    h sub 0  has an equals sign. Since there are no other words to indicate    h sub a , assume it says that the means are different. This is a two-tailed test.

(b) Revolving the region about the line  y is equal to negative 2  generates a solid of revolution with a cylindrical hole through its middle.\n##figure1.gif##
We cannot apply the formula to this problem directly because the axis of revolution is not one of the coordinate axes. However, we still know that the area of the cross-section is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. Looking at the graph of the function, we see the radius of the outer circle is given by , f of x plus 2, .
What is , f of x plus 2, ?
The radius of the inner circle is  g of x is equal to, 2 . Therefore, we have    v, is equal to the integral from 0 to 4 of pi times, parentheses 6 minus x,  squared minus 2 squared d x .

We have enough information to figure out the vertical dimensions-- the height-- of the parallelogram. We know that the parallelogram is bounded by  g of x is equal to, 2  and the  x  axis, so the height is  2 .
We can figure out the horizontal dimensions by first finding the equation of the line that passes through  times, parentheses 6 comma 1,  , then finding its  x  values when  y   is equal to,   0  (meaning it intersects the  x  axis) and when it intersects  g of x is equal to 2 .
We know that the line passing through  times, parentheses 6 comma 1,   is parallel to  f of x is equal to, 3 x . What this means is that the line we want to find also has a slope of  3 . Since we know the slope of the line and a point on the line, we can plug this into the equation  y is equal to m x plus b  to find  b . We know that the point , parentheses 6 comma 1,   means  y is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to, 6 , and the slope,  m , is  3 . Thus,  1 is equal to 3 times 6 plus, b . Solving for  b , we get that  b is equal to, negative 17 . Therefore, the equation of the line is  3 x minus 17 .
Using the equation of the line  y is equal to, 3 x minus 17 , when  y is equal to 0 , what is  x ?
Using the equation of the line  y is equal to, 3 x minus 17 , when  y is equal to 2 , what is  x ?
We now know that the horizontal base of the paralleogram is starts at  x is equal to, 17 thirds  and ends at  y, is equal to 19 thirds . We can find the length of the base by subtracting  17 thirds  from  19 thirds , which gives us  2 thirds .
The area of a parallelogram is the height times the base. In equation form, ,   a is equal to b h .

The first step is to identity the changing quantities. From the problem, we can see that the year town populations change, so our variables are "time" and "population."
The next step is to define input and output. Our input is "time," and our output is "population." To make the input nicer, instead of defining time with the year number, we will let time, represented by the variable  t , be equal to the number of years after  2004 . Thus, in  2004 ,  t   is equal to   0 . Our output is P(t), which represents population as a function of time.
We need to determine the rate of change-- that is, the change in output over the change in input. This is equivalent to the slope of the linear model, which is constant by the definition of linearity (a line.)
In  2004 ,  t  , is equal to,   0  and P(t) , is equal to   6200 . We can represent this with the coordinate point , parentheses 0 comma 6200,  . In  2009 ,  t   is equal to,   5  (since  2009, minus 2004 is equal to 5   and P(t)  is equal to   8100 , giving us the point , parentheses 5 comma 8100,  . The slope,  m , is calculated as the change in  y  over the change in  x .
What is  8100 minus 6200, ?
What is  5 minus 0, ?
What is  1900 over 5, ?
We have determined that the slope is  380   people over year  (since we dividing the change in  y , which was in units of people, by the change in  x , which was in units of years.) For the equation of the line, we need to know the y-intercept, which occurs when  t   is equal to   0 .
When  t is equal to, 0 ,    p of t is equal to ?
The slope is  380  and the  y  intercept is  6200 , so we know the line  y   is equal to  mx +  b , with  y  being P(t),  x  being  t ,  m  being slope, and  b  being the y-intercept, is    p of t is equal to, 380 t plus 6200 .
To predict the population in  2013 , we find the value of P(t) when  t  , is equal to,   9  (Since  2013, minus 2004 is equal to 9  .
When  t   is equal to,   9 , and    p of t is equal to, 380 t plus 6200 , what is the value of P(9)?
We are given that the population, P(t), is equal to  15000 , so now we need to solve for  t . Using the equation obtained in part a, we get that  15000 is equal to, 380 t plus 6200 .
 15000 is equal to 380 t plus 6200 , so  15000, minus 6200 is equal to, 380 t .  t  is equal to about?
The first step is to identify the changing variables and assigning them to input and output. Our input will be  t , time in hours, and our output will be A(t), distance in miles, and E(t), distance in miles.
Because it is not obvious how to define our output variable, we’ll start by drawing a picture such as in the image attached to this hint.\n##figure1.gif##
They both start at the same intersection so when , t is equal to, 0 , the distance traveled by each person should also be  0 . Thus the initial value for each is  0 .
Anna is walking , 4  miles per hour and Emanuel is walking  3  miles per hour, which are both rates of change. The slope for A is  4  and the slope for E is  3 .
For this problem, the distances from the starting point are important. To notate these, we can define a coordinate system, identifying the “starting point” at the intersection where they both started. Then we can use the variable, A, which we introduced above, to represent Anna’s position, and define it to be a measurement from the starting point in the eastward direction. Likewise, can use the variable, E, to represent Emanuel’s position, measured from the starting point in the southward direction. Note that in defining the coordinate system, we specified both the starting point of the measurement and the direction of measure.
We can then define a third variable, D, to be the measurement of the distance between Anna and Emanuel. Showing the variables on the diagram is often helpful, as we can see from the attached image. Recall that we need to know how long it takes for D, the distance between them, to equal  2  miles. Notice that for any given input 𝑡, the outputs A(t), E(t), and D(t) represent distances.\n##figure2.gif##

   d of t, is equal to 5 t colon  this means that the distance between Anna and Emanuel is also a linear function. Because D is a linear function, we can now answer the question of when the distance between them will reach  2  miles. We will set the output    d of t is equal to, 2   d of t, is equal to 2  and solve for  t .
   d of t, is equal to, 5 t , so  5 t is equal to 2 .  t, is equal to ?
It might help here to draw a picture of the situation. See the attached image. It would then be helpful to introduce a coordinate system. While we could place the origin anywhere, placing it at Westborough seems convenient. This puts Agritown at coordinates  parentheses 30 comma 10,  comma parentheses 30 comma 10,  , and Eastborough at , parentheses 20 comma 0,  .
Using the point  times, parentheses 30 comma 10,  , we can find the slope of the line from Westborough to Agritown. Slope  is equal to,  Change in  y over Change,  in  x   is equal to   fraction, 30 minus 0, over, 10 minus 0,  is equal to 3 .
Now we can write an equation to describe the road from Westborough to Agritown,    w of x, is equal to, 1 third x . From this, we can determine the perpendicular road to Eastborough will have slope  m, is equal to negative 3 . Because the town of Eastborough is at the point , parentheses 20 comma 0,  , we can find the equation.
   e of x, is equal to, negative 3 x, plus b . When  x is equal to 20 ,  b, is equal to ?
We can now find the coordinates of the junction of the roads by finding the intersection of these lines. Setting them equal,  1 third x, is equal to, negative 3 x, plus 60 .
 1 third x, is equal to, negative 3 x, plus 60 ,  x is equal to ?
Next, subsitute  x is equal to 18  back into the original equation.  y, is equal to   w of 18, is equal to, fraction, 1 over, 3 times 18,  .
 y is equal to fraction, 1 over, 3 times 18,  ,  y is equal to ?
Thus, the roads intersect at , parentheses 18 comma 6,  . Using the distance formula, we can now find the distance from Westborough to the junction.
The first step is to indentify input and output. The input is  d , distance driven in miles: the outputs are K(d): cost, in dollars, for renting from Keep on Trucking, and M(d): cost, in dollars, for renting from Move It Your Way.
The initial value is the up-front fee:    k of 0, is equal to, 20  and    m of 0 is equal to 16 colon  the rates of change are    k of d, is equal to, dollars 0.59,  /mile and    p of d is equal to, dollars 0.63  /mile.
A linear function is of the form  f of x is equal to m x plus, b . Using the rates of change and initial charges, we can write the equations    k of d is equal to 0.59 d plus, 20  and    m of d is equal to, 0.63 d plus 16 .
Using these equations, we can determine when Keep on Trucking, Inc., will be the better choice. Because all we have to make that decision from is the costs, we are looking for when Move It Your Way, will cost less, or when ,   k of d, is less than   m of d . The solution pathway will lead us to find the equations for the two functions, find the intersection, and then see where the K(d) function is smaller. The attached image shows the graph of the two functions, with K(d) in blue.\n##figure1.gif##
To find the intersection, we set the equations equal and solve.    k of d, is equal to   m of d , so  0.59 d plus 20 is equal to, 0.63 d plus 16 .
 0.59 d plus 20, is equal to, 0.63 d plus 16 ,  d is equal to ?
The value of  d  tells us that the cost from the two companies will be the same if  100  miles are driven. Either by looking at the graph, or noting that K(d) is growing at a slower rate, we can conclude that Keep on Trucking, Inc. will be the cheaper price when more than  100  miles are driven, that is  d is greater than 100 .
The first step is to identify the input and output of the equation.
The input is donuts,  x , and the output is cost, c.
The initial value is the fixed cost of  25000 .
The rate of change is the value of change in output over change in input. We know that the rate of change is , 0.25  because it takes  0.25,  units of output to produce a single unit of input, a donut.
The equation of a linear model is  y is equal to m x plus, b , where  y  is the output,  x  is the input,  m  is the rate of change, and  b  is the initial value. Plug in the values we have found to obtain the final answer.
The y-intercept is the value of the output when the value of the input is  0 . Using the equation we derived in part a, when  x, is equal to, 0 ,    c, is equal to 25000 .

The first step is to build a linear model. For simplicity, we will define the input as years from  2008 , and the output as population. The initial value is  28200  and the rate of change is  fraction, 36800 minus 28200, over, 4 minus 0,  , or the change in output over the change in input.
What is  fraction, 36800 minus 28200, over, 4 minus 0,  ?
The rate of change is  2150   people over year , so the equation is    p of t is equal to 2150 t plus, 28200 , where  t  is years since  2008  and P(t) is the population.
   p of t, is equal to 2150 t plus, 28200  when  t   is equal to   6  (since  2014  is  6  years after 2008),    p of 6 is equal to ?
Solve for  t  when    p of t is equal to, 54000 .  54000, is equal to, 2150 t plus 28200 ,  t is equal to ?
Graphing the problem is useful to understand the geometry we are working with. First, label a point T to represent the town of Timpson. We know that Ashburn is  60  miles east and  12  miles north of Timpson, so indicate a point A for Ashburn  60  units right of Timpson and  12  units up. This can be done by setting point T at the origin, , parentheses 0 comma 0,  , and setting point A at , parentheses 60 comma 12,  . We know that Garrison is perpendicular to the line connecting , parentheses 0 comma 0,   and , parentheses 60 comma 12,  , based on the problem's given information. We can label Garrison as point G, at , parentheses 20 comma 0,   to represent being  20  units east of point T. From the graph, we can tell that we are trying to find the point of the intersection between the line perpendicular to the line connecting T and A, that also goes through , parentheses 20 comma 0,  .
The slope of the line between A and T is , 60 over 12, is equal to 5, .
The slope of the perpendicular line is  fraction, negative 1, over 5,  .  0 is equal to 20, fraction, negative 1, over 5,  plus b , so  b is equal to 4 . The line is  y, is equal to fraction, negative 1, over 5,  x plus 4 .
 fraction, negative 1, over 5,  x plus 4 is equal to, 5 x ,  x, is equal to ?
 x is equal to, 10 over 13, ,  f of 10 over 13 is equal to ?
 the square root of parentheses 50 over 13,  squared plus, parentheses 10 over 13,  squared end root is equal to ?
We have enough information to figure out the length of the horizontal base. We know that the parallelogram is bounded by  x is equal to, 0  (the  y  axis) and  x is equal to 3 , so it is  3  units wide.
(It is useful to graph the information to better understand the geometry involved.) To find the vertical dimensions, first find the equation of the line that passes through  times, parentheses 2 comma 7,  . Then, see where it intersects the  y  axis, and alsto where f(x) intersects the  y  axis. Parallelograms have equal vertical bases, so the difference in the  y  coordinates will be the length of the vertical base.
We know that the line passing through  times, parentheses 2 comma 7,   is parallel to  f of x is equal to 1 plus, 2 x . What this means is that the line we want to find also has a slope of  2 . Since we know the slope of the line and a point on the line, we can plug this into the equation  y is equal to m x plus b  to find  b . We know that the point , parentheses 2 comma 7,   means  y is equal to 7  and  x, is equal to, 2 , and the slope,  m , is  2 . Thus,  7 is equal to 2 times 2 plus, b . Solving for  b , we get that  b is equal to, 3 . Therefore, the equation of the line is  2 x, plus 3 .
Next, we can find where this line intersects the  y  axis. At the  y  axis,  x is equal to, 0 , so plug in  0  to the equation. When  x is equal to 0 ,  y, is equal to, 2 times 0 plus 3, is equal to 3 . Thus, the coordinate point of one of the vertices is , parentheses 0 comma 3,  .
We can then find where f(x) intersects the  y  axis. Plugging in  x, is equal to, 0 , we get  f of 0, is equal to 1 . Thus, the other vertice that we are looking for is , parentheses 0 comma 1,  .
The difference of the  y  coordinates of the two points we have found is  3, minus 1, is equal to 3 . Thus, the vertical base has a length of  2 .

The area formula for a triangle is , 1 half b h, , where  b  is the base and  h  is the height.
First draw, a diagram. By graphing f(x) and the line perpendicular to it, we can tell that the height of the triangle is equal to the y-coordinate of the intersection between f(x) and the perpendicular line. We can also see that the horizontal base of the triangle is the distance from  times, parentheses 0 comma 0,   to the point where f(x) intersects the  x  axis.
The first step is to figure out the equation of the perpendicular line. Because it is perpendicular to  f of x is equal to, 12 minus 1 third x , we know that its slope is equal to the opposite reciprocal of the slope of f(x).

When  x is equal to 85 over 42, , , f of, parentheses 85 over 42,  is equal to ?
Through graphing, we know that the y-coordinate of the intersection is the height of the triangle, and the intersection has coordinates  parentheses, 85 over 42, comma 356 over 49  . Thus, the height of the triangle is  356 over 49 .
When  y is equal to, 0 , f(x) intersects the  x  axis. Plug in  y is equal to, 0  to the equation for f(x). What is  x  equal to when  y is equal to 0 ?
The base of the triangle is equal to the x-coordinate of the intersection between f(x) and the  x  axis.

Consider what makes sense in terms of domain and range. Will negative  x  and negative  y,  values make sense in this equation?
The domain, years would start at  0  and would end at five. Thus, the range would be from the population at the beginning to the population five years later.
Thirty years before the start of this model, the town had no citizens. Initially, the town had a population of 75,000.
Slope is the change in output over the change in input.
In this problem, the output is population and the input is time in years.
Every unit of change for the input, which is a year, corresponds to , 2500  units of change for the output, which is the population. Thus, the slope is  2500, , and it represents the change in population over change in time.

Since the given data set is ordered from smallest to biggest, we can just take the first number (which is the smallest). So the smallest value of this data set is  60 .
The smallest data value is  60 . Since the data with the most decimal places has one decimal (for instance,  61.5  , we want our starting point to have two decimal places. Since the numbers  0.5 ,  0.05 ,  0.005 , etc. are convenient numbers, use  0.05  and subtract it from  60 , the smallest value, for the convenient starting point.\n 60 minus 0.05   is equal to   59.95  which is more precise than, say,  61.5  by one decimal place. The starting point is, then,  59.95 .
Since the given data set is ordered from smallest to biggest, we can just take the last number (which is the biggest). So the smallest value of this data set is  74 .
Since the data with the most decimal places has one decimal, we want our ending point to have two decimal places. Since the numbers  0.5 ,  0.05 ,  0.005 , etc. are convenient numbers, use  0.05  and add it to  74 , the smallest value, for the convenient ending point.The largest value is  74 , so  74  +  0.05   is equal to   74.05  is the ending value.
Since the lowest data point is zero and we can not have negative number of hours, the starting point of the histogram is  0 . Some values in this data set fall on boundaries for the class intervals. A value is counted in a class interval if it falls on the left boundary.

There are two types of sampling that divide the population into groups of people: stratified and cluster. The differences between the two are that stratified sampling takes a proportionate number of subjects from each stratum to include into the sample while clustering usually means only a few clusters are selected to represent the entire population.

The high school educational researcher wants to interview  50  high school female teachers and  50,  high school male teachers. Therefore, you know that the two separate groups are high school female teachers and high school male teachers. To decide whether this is stratified or cluster sampling, we must think about whether every group is represented in the sample. Choose STRATIFIED if a proportion of each separate group is included in the final sample: choose CLUSTER if not all the groups are included in the final sample, but every member of the selected groups is included.

Regard the null hypothesis like the status quo.
At the moment, the prevailing belief is that
We know that the prevailing belief is that the bread height is less than 15cm. We also know that the null hypothesis is defined similarly to the status quo or the prevailing belief, therefore the null hypothesis is that the baker's bread is less than 15cm.
The baker making the claim forms the alternate hypothesis while the customers' opinion of bread height averages forms the null hypothesis.
Given the normal distribution of means, it is indicated that the  p minus value  is close to  0 . We can interpret it as    p, parentheses,   x is greater than 17,   is approximately zero.
A , p minus, value  of approximately zero tells us that it is highly unlikely that a loaf of bread rises no more than  15  cm, on average. That is, almost 0% of all loaves of bread would be at least as high as  17  cm.
Since the outcome of 17cm is so unlikely we can conclude that the evidence is strongly against the null hypothesis (that the mean height is at most 15cm)
Is there sufficient evidence that the true mean height for the population of the baker's loaves of bread is greater than 15cm?
The results of the sample data are significant if \alpha>p-value. There is significant evidence to conclude that ,   h sub 0  is an incorrect belief and that the alternative hypothesis,    h sub a , may be correct.

Recall what decisions must be made to decide what distribution would be best to perform hypothesis tests. When you use a normal distribution for a hypothesis test (often called a  z minus test  , a simple random sample is taken from the population and the population that you are working with is normally distributed or the sample size is sufficiently large.
When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population mean μ using a Student's  t minus distribution  (often called a  t, minus test  , there are fundamental assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to work properly. Your data should be a simple random sample that comes from a population that is approximately normally distributed. You use the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation.
Exponential distributions involves a continuous random variable that appears when we are interested in the intervals of time between some random events. Take for example, the length of time between emergency arrivals at a hospital.
Exponential distributions cannot be used for hypothesis testing, the only eligible distributions are normal and  t minus test,  distributions.
We can either choose normal or , t minus test  distribution. Although the data in this context is approximately normal and we could use normal distribution, since we are unaware of the population standard deviation, the  t, minus test  is the best choice for this hypothesis testing scenario.

We are testing for the mean of our data, so the components of the distribution formed should be the means.
The estimate value or point estimate is a single number computed from a sample and used to estimate a population parameter.
The population parameter in this case is the population mean, therefore the point estimate of our test should be the sample mean: we are using sample means to estimate the population mean in our test.
Recall that if you are testing a single population proportion, the distribution for the test is for proportions or percentages: P'~N(p,sqrt((p*q)/n). In single population proportion testing, the estimated value is the number of successes divided by the sample size.
When conducting a hypothesis test of a single population proportion  p , you must meet conditions for a binomial distribution, where the quantities  n p  and  n q  are greater than  5 . q is the complementary probably of succession  parentheses, q is equal to 1 minus p  .
The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be a similar shape to that of the normal distribution. In order to assess similarity, we ensure the product of , n  and  p  and the product of  n  and q are both greater than  5 .
In hypothesis testing of the single population proportion, we ensure all of the axioms described before are true in order to "substitute" our binomial distribution with the normal distribution because it is more convenient to use it and it is an effort to take advantage of the normal distribution's properties that can be useful for hypothesis testing.
State the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
After declaring the null and alternative hypothesis, we consider the random variable , x  and the distribution it will make. First, we aren't given any information on the population standard deviation, therefore the  t, minus distribution  should be used.

A key factor that can differentiate the viability of , t minus test  versus  z, minus test  is the standard deviation. To be more exact, it must be the population standard deviation. What is the population standard deviation of student hours in hours? Round to the nearest four decimal places.
We can either choose normal or  t minus test  distribution. Although the data in this context is approximately normal and we could use  t, minus testing  distribution, since we are aware of the population standard deviation, the  t, minus test  is unnecessary and the normal distribution is the best choice for this hypothesis testing scenario.
Remember that degrees of freedom for  t minus test  distributions is  n, minus 1 , where  n  is the population

Consider the context: a new drug is being tested, therefore the null hypothesis is that the proportion is greater or equal to assume the worst in its effectiveness.
We know that the null assumption proportion is equal to the control or greater if it is an option. The alternative claim, or attribute that is being tested is if the drug reduced the proportion of people that developed AIDS in four years since the aim is to hinder or stop AIDS development.
There is no need to calculate differences data as the sample mean and standard deviation are given.
Methods to calculate the , p minus value  will vary by calculator, make sure to use a  t, minus test .
The key testing feature is that blood pressure is decreased after training. Suppose u denotes blood pressure level change, which of the following claims are correct?
Using  x is equal to, negative 10.2 ,  s, is equal to 8.4 , and  n, is equal to 6 , the test statistic can be found through the formula test statistic  t, is equal to fraction, x minus 0, over, fraction, s over, the square root of n   
The computed test statistic is  fraction, negative 10.2, over, fraction, 8.4 over, the square root of 6   , the  p minus value  can be found in the form P(t_5<=-10.2/(8.4/sqrt(6)))
It is found that    p minus value, is equal to 0.0155  approximately, since the  p, minus value  is less than  0.05 , our significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected and there is suffcient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that blood pressure decreased after the special exercise protocol.
When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population mean μ using a Student's  t minus distribution  (often called a  t, minus test  , there are fundamental assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to work properly. Your data should be a simple random sample that comes from a population that is approximately normally distributed. You use the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation.
Recall what decisions must be made to decide what distribution would be best to perform hypothesis tests. When you use a normal distribution for a hypothesis test (often called a  z minus test  , a simple random sample is taken from the population and the population that you are working with is normally distributed or the sample size is sufficiently large.
Remember that degrees of freedom for  t minus test  distributions is  n, minus, 1 , where  n  is the population.  n  is  6  in this case.
Calculate the differences between the corresponding players when weight was lifted prior and after the class to get an ordered list of differences.
What is the calculated difference of Player 1?
The difference of Player 1's weight prior and after the class is can be found by subtracting  295  and  205 . Do the same for the rest of the set of players.
You may use the new list of differences to find the mean differences by adding all the terms and dividing by the number of terms in the list. You may alternatively put the differences data on a table on your graphing calculator to find the sample mean.

The choices provided are really similar. It is best to choose the random variable that best represents our sample. In this case, the maximum weight lifted difference per player is the random variable.
If the level of significance is 5%, the decision is not to reject the null hypothesis, because the significance value , 0.05 is less than, p minus value , therefore, given our sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the strength development class helped to make the players stronger, on average.
Recall that the , p minus value  is the probability that an event will happen purely by chance assuming the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the  p, minus value , the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis.
The level of significance in this instance is , 0.05 . Our  p, minus value  is less than that boundary value, therefore there is statistical significance of a lower proportion of patients that developed AIDS in four years when taking the new drug compared to the control group.
Input the differences data into a calculator to obtain the mean differences and standard deviation to get the test statistic.
This is a paired  t minus test,  as the before and after data is provided as we are testing the mean difference between pairs of measurements if they are zero or not.
The test statistic can be found through the formula test statistic  t is equal to fraction, x minus 0, over, fraction, s over, the square root of n   .
The probability of obtaining our test statistic is  0.841 , and the test statistic obtained is  negative 1.19 , what is the  p minus value ?
Since , 0.841 is greater than 0.05 , the null hypothesis is rejected and there is sufficient evidence that the new technique taught by the golf instructor can improve golf players' scores.
For the TI-83+ and TI-84 calculators, you can either calculate the differences ahead of time (after - before) and put the differences into a list or you can put the after data into a first list and the before data into a second list. Then go to a third list and arrow up to the name. Enter 1st list name - 2nd list name. The calculator will do the subtraction, and you will have the differences in the third list.

We are testing if the measurements, on average, are lower after hypnotism.
We can now start formulating the claims. We have before and after data and have a null assumption that there is a mean zero difference between the data, therefore we are conducting a paired two sample test.
We must assume that there are no effects post hypnotism. Let  mu sub d  denote the difference in before and after pain measurements.
Let  mu sub d  denote the difference in pain measurements.
Which of the following claim pairs matches the situation described?
We must assume that the treatment offered is worse for pain or has no effect, therefore the mean differences in pain measurements by default is greater than or equal to zero.

test statistic  t is equal to x sub d minus mu sub d divided by parentheses s sub d divided by s, q r t of n  ,  otherwise   known   a s   t h e,   quantity   mean   sample   difference   subtracted   b y   t h e,   population   mean   f o r,   t h e,   differences   divided   b y   t h e,   sample   standard   deviation   divided   b y   t h e,   square   root   o f   n .  Note   that   this   i s   a   t   distribution   with   degrees   o f   freedom   n minus 1 .
We must know the mean (, x bar, sub d ) and standard deviation differences( s sub d ). Using a graphing calculator, the mean differences and the standard deviation of differences can be found in the STAT menu. The mean difference is found to be  3.125 .
With mean difference equalling  3.125 ,  s sub d =2.91143  parentheses t h e,   standard   deviation   o f   differences  ,  a n d,   n is equal to 8 ,  test   statistic   t is equal to 3.03591 .  Round   t o   four   decimal   places 
Under the P-value table associated with  t is equal to, 3.0359  and degrees of freedom equaling  8, plus 8 minus 2 is equal to 14 , the  p, minus value  is found to be  0.00948 .
Since  0.00948 , the  p, minus value , is less than our significance level of  0.05 , the result is significant and we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference.

We must plug in the values  x is equal to 3, comma y is equal to, negative 2 , and  z, is equal to, 1  into the system of equations.\n 3, minus 2 plus 1 is equal to 2 . This is true.\n6(3)-4(-2)+5(1)=31. This is also true.\n5(3)+2(-2)+2(1)=13. This is also true. This meaens that the ordered pair is a solution and the answer is 'y'.
We can eliminate  x  to add the first two equations to get  y, plus 2 z is equal to 3 . We must however, find another equation without  x  in it. To do this, we must multiply equation  1  by  negative 2  and add the result to equation  3 . This will result in the equation  negative y minus z is equal to negative 1 .
We can solve for  z  by adding the two equations derived in the previous step:  y, plus 2 z is equal to, 3  and  negative y, minus z is equal to, negative 1 . The sum is  z, is equal to 2 . We can now back-substitute  z  into  y, plus 2 z is equal to 3  to get  y, is equal to negative 1 . Finally, this can all be plugged back into equation  1  to yield the solution for  x .  x plus 2 plus 6 is equal to 9 ,  x, is equal to 1 .
To solve this problem, we use all of the information given and set up three equations. First, we assign a variable to each of the three investment amounts:  x is equal to, mone y sub market,  fund,  y is equal to, municipal  bonds,  z, is equal to mutual  funds. With these variables, we can create the three following equations based on the information given in the word problem: x+y+z=12000,z=y+4000,0.03x+0.04y+0.07z=670. These three equations make a system. To make the caculations easier, the last equation can be multipled by  100 , giving us  3 x plus 4 y plus 7 z is equal to 67000 
To solve this equation, we must first multiply equation  1  by  negative 3 , giving us  y plus 4 z is equal to, 31000 . We can now add equation  2  to that derived in the eprevious step to give us  5 z is equal to, 35000 ,  z, is equal to 7000 . With  z , we can solve for y: we plug back in to equation  2  and solve for  y .  negative y plus 7000 is equal to 4000 comma y is equal to 3000 . Finally, we plug  z  and  y  into equation  1  to get  x plus 3000 plus 7000 is equal to, 12000 , leading to  x, is equal to 2000 . Thus, we have the soluttion nas (2000,3000,7000)
We can multiply equation  3  by  negative 3  and add to the second equation to get  3 y is equal to 10 z is equal to negative 13 . This eliminates the  x, minus variablee  in one equation, but we must do it in another as well. So, we can multiply equation  3  by  negative 2  and add to the third equation to get  5 y minus 8 z is equal to negative 13 
With the equations derived in the previous steps, we can solve for  z . We can multiply  5 y, minus 8 z is equal to negative 13  by , fraction, negative 5, over 3,   and add to  3 y minus 10 z is equal to, negative 13  to get  z, is equal to 1 . This can be substituted back into  5 y, minus 8 z is equal to, negative 13  to get  y, is equal to, negative 1 . All this can be substituted into the first equation to get  x, is equal to 1 .
We can eliminate  x  by adding equation  1  to equation  2  to get  negative y minus 4 z is equal to 7 . We can then multiply equation  1  by  negative 5  and add to equation  3  to get  2 y plus 8 z is equal to negative 12 .
Equation  4  can be multiplied by  2  and added to equation  5  to try and solve for  z . However, this leads to both variables  z  and  y  to be cancelled out, leading to the equation  0 is equal to 2 . Since this is false, the system is inconsistent.
To eliminate  x , multiply the first equation by  negative 2  and add the result to the third equation. We get  negative y plus 3 z is equal to, negative 4 . If we add this to the second equation, we get  0, is equal to negative 3 , which is false. So, the system is inconsistent.
First, we can multiply equation  1  by  negative 2  and add it to equation  2 , but this gives us  0 is equal to 0  which is always true. S
This means that we must find the general solution, or the solution in terms of  x . Add equations  1  and  2  to get  3 x minus 2 z is equal to 0 .  z, is equal to 3 halves x, . Back-substitute the expressionn for  z  and solve for  y .  2 x plus y minus 9 halves x is equal to 0 comma, y is equal to 5 halves x . So, the solution is (x,5/2x,3/2x)
Multiply the first equation by  minus, 3  and add the result to the second equation. This gives us  negative 5 y minus 4 z is equal to negative 17 . Now, multiply thee first equation by  negative 1  and add to the third equation to get  5 y plus 4 z is equal to 17 . Add these two equations together to get  0, is equal to 0 . This system is dependent.
Solve for  y  in the equation  5 y, plus 4 z minus 17  to get  y is equal to fraction, negative 4, over 5,  t plus, 17 fifths . Substitute this into the first equation to find  x .  x plus parentheses, negative 4 fifths z, plus 17 fifths  plus z is equal to 7 comma x is equal to fraction, negative 1, over 5,  z plus 18 fifths .

A one-way ANOVA hypothesis test determines if several population means are equal. The distribution for the test is the F distribution with two different degrees of freedom.
Consider the option that all the group means are not approximately equal to one another. In an ANOVA test, the alternative hypothesis is that out of all the group means considered, at least two of the group means are different, while the null prevailing belief is that the group means are approximately the same.
In a one-way ANOVA test, the standard deviation in the groups should be equal to one another.
Consider the factor. This is the independent variable or predictor, and the factor is another way of reffering to a categorical variable. Take for example, in an experiment, the different planned treatments denote the different factors.
Analysis of variance extends the comparison of two groups to several, each a level of a categorical variable (factor). Samples from each group are independent, and must be randomly selected from normal populations with equal variances. We test the null hypothesis of equal means of the response in every group versus the alternative hypothesis of one or more group means being different from the others.

In a one-way ANOVA test, the default prevailing belief is that the group means are equal.
Since the prevailing belief is that the group means are equal, then the alternative hypothesis would be that at least two of the group means aren't the same to each other.
In a one-way ANOVA test, the default prevailing belief is that the group means are equal.
The alternative claim is that at least two of the group means aren't equal. The prevailing belief is that the group means are approximately equal to each other.
We are interested to see if teenagers obtain their licenses in the same average ages across the country.
The null hypothesis is that all the group population means are the same. We can see from the table that the values are also relatively similar to one another across the regions.
We are testing to see if the average age significantly varies in at least one of the five groups because we want to see if there really is a same average age across the regions in the country.

This is because the probability of having fruit in school lunches was brought up before the probability of not having fruit in school lunches. In addition, this means that a "failure" would be a school lunch not having fruit.

Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed.
The statistical value could be variance or standard deviation. Let the variance of instructors  1  and  2  equal  sigma sub 1 and \sigma_2  respectively .    t h e,   instructors   a r e,   concerned   with   variation   o f   test   results ,  therefore   a   test   o f   t w o,   variances   will   b e   performed .
Test the claim that the first instructor's variance is smaller is a key indicator of the alternative hypothesis.
By default, the variances are expected to be the same among college instructors, so let that be the null hypothesis.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same, the F statistic is  fraction, s sub 1 squared, over, s sub 2 squared,  , where s would denote the sample variance.
Instructor 1's variance is , 52.3 , and instructor 2's variance is  89.9, . divide instructor 1's variance with instructor 2's variance.
,   f is equal to 52.3 over 89.9 
Since the alternative claim is that instructor 1's grade variances are less than that of instructor  2 , the test will be left tailed.
In a hypothesis test, a  p minus, value  lower than the significance level means that the null hypothesis is rejected. With a 10% of significance converted to  0.10 , the significance level is higher than the  p minus value  of  0.0753 .
The bikers are interested in whether or not the variances are the same. This indicates that a two tailed test is being performed.
Variances will be compared. Variances are squares of the standard deviation.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same, let s denote the standard deviations. The F statistic is  fraction, s sub 1 squared, over, s sub 2 squared,  .
Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let  sigma times times 2 sub 1 and \sigma**{2}_{2}  b e   t h e,   population   variances   a n d,  , s times times 2 sub 1, and s**{2}_{1}  b e   t h e,   sample   variances .    l e t,   t h e,   sample   sizes   b e   n sub 1   a n d, .  sub 2 .  Since   w e   a r e,   interested   i n   comparing   t h e,   t w o,   sample   variances ,  w e   u s e,   t h e,     f   ratio :    f   is equal to  \dfrac{\left[\dfrac{(s_{1})**{2}}{(\sigma_{1})**{2}}\right]}{\left[\dfrac{(s_{2})**{2}}{(\sigma_{2})**{2}}\right]}
Given the variances, we can take the square root of each of them to find the standard deviation, and thereafterwards divide them by each other to get our F statistic.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same. Let s denote the standard deviations. The F statistic is  fraction, s sub 1 squared, over, s sub 2 squared,  .
By  fraction, 38.1 squared, over, 22.5 squared,  , the F statistic is  2.8674 
Student 1's standard deviation is , 38.1 , and student 2's standard deviation is  22.5, . Divide student 1's variance with student 2's variance.
Let the variance of students  1  and  2  equal  sigma sub 1 and \sigma_2  respectively .    t h e,   students   a r e,   concerned   with   variation   o f   grade   results ,  therefore   a   test   o f   t w o,   variances   will   b e   performed .
If the second student thinks that he is more consistent, then that signals that his variance in grades is smaller than the first student. Let that claim be the alternative hypothesis.
The students are interested if there is variation between their grades or not, therefore the null hypothesis is that their variations are the same approximately.
Let T1  is equal to,  tenor  1 , and B2 , is equal to  bass  2 . The standard deviations of the samples are , s sub   t 1 end sub is equal to, 3.3302  and , s sub   b 2 end sub is equal to 2.7208  after inputting the data into separate groups of Bass and Tenor men.
Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed.
By default, the height variances are equal to each other, and the challenging statement that motivates the test is that the variance of heights go up with lower voices. It's hard to form an alternative hypothesis inequality statement off of this, so formulate the hypotheses based off of the base question if the variance of the heights of the singers of the two groups are different from each other.
State the null and alternative hypotheses. Let  sigma times times 2 sub T1 denote Tenor 1 singers and \sigma**{2}_{\text{B2}}  denote   Bass   2   players .
If the key motivation behind the test is finding a difference in variances, then the alternative hypothesis is that the variances of the two groups concerned aren't equal to each other.
What is the F statistic? Round to four decimal places/
Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let  sigma times times 2 sub 1 and \sigma**{2}_{2}  b e   t h e,   population   variances   a n d,  , s times times 2 sub 1, and s**{2}_{1}  b e   t h e,   sample   variances .    l e t,   t h e,   sample   sizes   b e   n sub 1   a n d, .  sub 2 .  Since   w e   a r e,   interested   i n   comparing   t h e,   t w o,   sample   variances ,  w e   u s e,   t h e,     f   ratio :    f   is equal to  \dfrac{\left[\dfrac{(s_{1})**{2}}{(\sigma_{1})**{2}}\right]}{\left[\dfrac{(s_{2})**{2}}{(\sigma_{2})**{2}}\right]}
Calculate the F statistic by squaring each of the standard deviations and dividing the tenor group by the bass group squared standard deviations. Remember to round to four decimal places.
The F statistic is  1.4894  with  20  and  25  degrees of freedom for Tenor  1  and Bass  2  respectively.
Another of the uses of the F distribution is testing two variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages. For instance, college administrators would like two college professors grading exams to have the same variation in their grading. In order for a lid to fit a container, the variation in the lid and the container should be the same. A supermarket might be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers.
In order to perform a F test of two variances, since the test in equality is very sensitive to deviation compared to other tests used, the populations must be consistent.
Since a test in two variances is very sensitive to deviations from normality, what would be a good assumption to make?
If the test is sensitive to deviations from normality, then the two populations being tested from which the two samples will be drawn should be normally distributed.
Another of the uses of the F distribution is testing two variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages. For instance, college administrators would like two college professors grading exams to have the same variation in their grading. In order for a lid to fit a container, the variation in the lid and the container should be the same. A supermarket might be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers.
When performing a test of two variances (or frankly most tests), we don't want our results to be affected by any other confounding variables.
Since we don't want to get our results messed up by external factors or data relation to each other, what would be a good assumption to ensure an efficient test of two variances?
Given the options listed, the best way to reduce confounding factors is to ensure that the two populations are independent of each other so that misleading correlations are avoided.
Let the variance of workers  1  and  2  equal  sigma sub 1 and \sigma_2  respectively .    t h e,   workers   a r e,   concerned   with   variation   o f   commute   times ,  therefore   a   test   o f   t w o,   variances   will   b e   performed .
If the first worker thinks that he is more consistent, then that signals that his variance in time to commute to work is smaller than the second worker. Let that claim be the alternative hypothesis.
By default, since the workers commute at the same place in the same distances, the variances will be equal to each other.
Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed.
We are given the sample variances. The variances are the standard deviations squared.
With the variance of worker , 1  being  12.1 , the sample standard deviation would be the square root of  12.1 .
We are given the sample variances. The variances are the standard deviations squared.

Remember that the IQR is the formula Quartile  3  - Quartile  1 . Therefore, to determine the quartiles, we'll first determine the median.
What is the median of the data set?
The definition for Quartile  1  is the middle value of the lower half of the data. The definition for Quartile  3  is the middle value for the upper half of the data. Remember that the halfpoint of the data is determined by the median, so we now need to find the middle points of the remaining data.

Remember that the IQR is the formula Quartile  3  - Quartile  1 . Therefore, to determine the quartiles, we'll first determine the median.
What is the median of the data set?
The definition for Quartile  1  is the middle value of the lower half of the data. The definition for Quartile  3  is the middle value for the upper half of the data. Remember that the halfpoint of the data is determined by the median, so we now need to find the middle points of the remaining data.
What is Quartile 1? What is the middle value of the lower half of the data?
What is Quartile 3? What is the middle value of the upper half of the data?
The definition of IQR (interquartile range) is the number that indicates the spread of the middle half or the middle 50% of the data. It is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile.

For a Box-and-Whisker Plot, we note that there are two boxes and two whiskers (two lines extending from the boxes). The boxes represent the quartiles: the first box goes from the first quartile to the second quartile and the second box goes from the second quartile to the third quartile. The whiskers represent the remaining data (the 25% of the data that is less than the first quartile and the 25% of the data greater than the third quartile).
As children are defined as age  17  and under while senior citizens are age  65  and over, are children and seniors represented as boxes or whiskers?
How much data does each of the whiskers represent?
Is the length of the whisker on the left shorter or the length of the whisker on the right shorter?
Does the left whisker (age  17  and under) include other age groups except children?
What percentage of the U.S. population is children?
Does the right whisker (age  50  and older) include other age groups except seniors?
What percentage of the U.S. population is seniors?
If there are other people also part of the whisker, which contains 25% of the data point, this means that the population of seniors does not take up the entire whisker. If a whisker contains 25% of the data, does this mean that seniors make up 25% of the data, <25% of the data, or >25% of the data?
Are there fewer or more children than senior citizens?
Is "25%" > "less than 25%"?

When examine the graph, it is clear that majority of the points are close to a linear line with equation , y is equal to, 7 ninths   x 


Linear Regression is the process of finding the line that best fits the data on the plot.
The number to the second power is always a positive numebr.
If , r   is equal to   negative 1 , there is perfect negative correlation.
The slope of the best-fit line tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (x) variable, on average.
 r squared , when expressed as a percent, represents the percent of variation in the dependent (predicted) variable  y  that can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable  x  using the regression  parentheses b e s t, minus f i t   line.
If , r   is equal to   1 , there is perfect positive correlation. However, there is not enough of data points to support to show that there is a strong positive correlation between the data sets.
The sum of the squared error is the sum of absolute value of a residual errors.
The criteria for the best fit line is that the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized, that is, made as small as possible.
The correlation coefficient is calculated as below, where , n   is equal to,  the number of data points.\n##figure1.gif##
If you suspect a linear relationship between , x  and  y , then  r,  can measure how strong the linear relationship is.
If , r   is equal to   1 , there is perfect positive correlation.
If , r   is equal to   negative 1 , there is perfect negative correlation
The sign of  r  is the same as the sign of the slope,  b, , of the best-fit line.
The sign of  r  is the same as the sign of the slope,  b, , of the best-fit line.
Strong correlation does not suggest that , x  causes  y  or  y  causes  x . We say "correlation does not imply causation."
 r squared  ythat can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable  x  using the regression  parentheses b e s t, minus f i t   line.
If  r   is equal to,   0  there is likely no linear correlation. It is important to view the scatterplot, however, because data that exhibit a curved or horizontal pattern may have a correlation of  0 .

A discrete variable is a variable that can only take on a finite amount of values. For example, the sizes of pizzas at a certain restaurant would be a discrete variable, since they can only have lengths of 8", 12", and 16".
A continuous variable is a variable that can take on an infinite amount of values. For example, the temperature outside your front door is continuous since it can have almost any value. Whether its  23.5 ,  20.111 dot dot dot, , or  25  degrees outside, the temperature can take on an infinite amount of values since we can have an infinite amount of decimal points.
Knowing the definition of discrete and continuous variables, is the answer to our initial question continuous or discrete?

One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a function at a point by using a known value of a function at some given point, f(a), together with its rate of change at the given point, f'(a). If f(x) is a function defined on an interval [a, a + h], then the amount of change of f(x) over the interval is the change in the  y  values of the function over that interval.
The function at some given point, a, is f(a), and its rate of change at the given point is f'(a). f(a + h) is the value that we wish to estimate. Solve for  h .

Now that you have found the values of a and a +  h , use the following equation (a + h) - a to solve for  h, .

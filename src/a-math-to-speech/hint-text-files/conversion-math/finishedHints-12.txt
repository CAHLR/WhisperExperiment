Regard the null hypothesis like the status quo.
At the moment, the prevailing belief is that
We know that the prevailing belief is that the bread height is less than 15cm. We also know that the null hypothesis is defined similarly to the status quo or the prevailing belief, therefore the null hypothesis is that the baker's bread is less than 15cm.
The baker making the claim forms the alternate hypothesis while the customers' opinion of bread height averages forms the null hypothesis.
Given the normal distribution of means, it is indicated that the ; p minus; value  is close to  0 . We can interpret it as ;  cap p, open paren,  cap x is greater than 17, close paren;  is approximately zero.
A , p minus, value  of approximately zero tells us that it is highly unlikely that a loaf of bread rises no more than  15  cm, on average. That is, almost 0% of all loaves of bread would be at least as high as  17;  cm.
Since the outcome of 17cm is so unlikely we can conclude that the evidence is strongly against the null hypothesis (that the mean height is at most 15cm)
Is there sufficient evidence that the true mean height for the population of the baker's loaves of bread is greater than 15cm?

Recall what decisions must be made to decide what distribution would be best to perform hypothesis tests. When you use a normal distribution for a hypothesis test (often called a  z minus test; close paren; , a simple random sample is taken from the population and the population that you are working with is normally distributed or the sample size is sufficiently large.
When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population mean μ using a Student's ; t minus distribution  (often called a  t, minus test; close paren; , there are fundamental assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to work properly. Your data should be a simple random sample that comes from a population that is approximately normally distributed. You use the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation.
Exponential distributions involves a continuous random variable that appears when we are interested in the intervals of time between some random events. Take for example, the length of time between emergency arrivals at a hospital.
Exponential distributions cannot be used for hypothesis testing, the only eligible distributions are normal and  t minus test,  distributions.
We can either choose normal or , t minus test  distribution. Although the data in this context is approximately normal and we could use normal distribution, since we are unaware of the population standard deviation, the  t, minus test;  is the best choice for this hypothesis testing scenario.

We are testing for the mean of our data, so the components of the distribution formed should be the means.
The estimate value or point estimate is a single number computed from a sample and used to estimate a population parameter.
The population parameter in this case is the population mean, therefore the point estimate of our test should be the sample mean: we are using sample means to estimate the population mean in our test.
Recall that if you are testing a single population proportion, the distribution for the test is for proportions or percentages: P'~N(p,sqrt((p*q)/n). In single population proportion testing, the estimated value is the number of successes divided by the sample size.
When conducting a hypothesis test of a single population proportion ; p , you must meet conditions for a binomial distribution, where the quantities  n p  and  n q  are greater than  5 . q is the complementary probably of succession ; open paren, q is equal to 1 minus p; close paren; .
The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be a similar shape to that of the normal distribution. In order to assess similarity, we ensure the product of , n  and  p  and the product of  n  and q are both greater than  5; .
In hypothesis testing of the single population proportion, we ensure all of the axioms described before are true in order to "substitute" our binomial distribution with the normal distribution because it is more convenient to use it and it is an effort to take advantage of the normal distribution's properties that can be useful for hypothesis testing.
State the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
After declaring the null and alternative hypothesis, we consider the random variable , x  and the distribution it will make. First, we aren't given any information on the population standard deviation, therefore the  t, minus distribution;  should be used.

A key factor that can differentiate the viability of , t minus test  versus  z, minus test;  is the standard deviation. To be more exact, it must be the population standard deviation. What is the population standard deviation of student hours in hours? Round to the nearest four decimal places.
We can either choose normal or ; t minus test  distribution. Although the data in this context is approximately normal and we could use  t, minus testing  distribution, since we are aware of the population standard deviation, the  t, minus test;  is unnecessary and the normal distribution is the best choice for this hypothesis testing scenario.
Remember that degrees of freedom for ; t minus test  distributions is  n, minus 1 , where  n;  is the population

The computed test statistic is ; fraction, negative 10.2, over, fraction, 8.4 over, the square root of 6; end fraction; end fraction; , the  p; minus value;  can be found in the form P(t_5<=-10.2/(8.4/sqrt(6)))
It is found that ;  cap p minus value, is equal to; 0.0155  approximately, since the  p, minus value  is less than  0.05; , our significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected and there is suffcient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that blood pressure decreased after the special exercise protocol.
When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population mean μ using a Student's ; t minus distribution  (often called a  t, minus test; close paren; , there are fundamental assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to work properly. Your data should be a simple random sample that comes from a population that is approximately normally distributed. You use the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation.
Recall what decisions must be made to decide what distribution would be best to perform hypothesis tests. When you use a normal distribution for a hypothesis test (often called a  z minus test; close paren; , a simple random sample is taken from the population and the population that you are working with is normally distributed or the sample size is sufficiently large.
Remember that degrees of freedom for ; t minus test  distributions is  n, minus, 1 , where  n  is the population.  n  is  6;  in this case.
Calculate the differences between the corresponding players when weight was lifted prior and after the class to get an ordered list of differences.
What is the calculated difference of Player 1?
The difference of Player 1's weight prior and after the class is can be found by subtracting  295  and  205; . Do the same for the rest of the set of players.
You may use the new list of differences to find the mean differences by adding all the terms and dividing by the number of terms in the list. You may alternatively put the differences data on a table on your graphing calculator to find the sample mean.

The choices provided are really similar. It is best to choose the random variable that best represents our sample. In this case, the maximum weight lifted difference per player is the random variable.
If the level of significance is 5%, the decision is not to reject the null hypothesis, because the significance value , 0.05 is less than, p minus value; , therefore, given our sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the strength development class helped to make the players stronger, on average.
Recall that the , p minus value  is the probability that an event will happen purely by chance assuming the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the  p, minus value; , the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis.
The level of significance in this instance is , 0.05 . Our  p, minus value;  is less than that boundary value, therefore there is statistical significance of a lower proportion of patients that developed AIDS in four years when taking the new drug compared to the control group.
Input the differences data into a calculator to obtain the mean differences and standard deviation to get the test statistic.
This is a paired  t minus test,  as the before and after data is provided as we are testing the mean difference between pairs of measurements if they are zero or not.
The test statistic can be found through the formula test statistic ; t is equal to; fraction, x minus 0, over, fraction, s over, the square root of n; end fraction; end fraction; .
The probability of obtaining our test statistic is ; 0.841 , and the test statistic obtained is  negative 1.19 , what is the  p; minus value; ?
Since , 0.841 is greater than 0.05; , the null hypothesis is rejected and there is sufficient evidence that the new technique taught by the golf instructor can improve golf players' scores.
For the TI-83+ and TI-84 calculators, you can either calculate the differences ahead of time (after - before) and put the differences into a list or you can put the after data into a first list and the before data into a second list. Then go to a third list and arrow up to the name. Enter 1st list name - 2nd list name. The calculator will do the subtraction, and you will have the differences in the third list.

We are testing if the measurements, on average, are lower after hypnotism.
We can now start formulating the claims. We have before and after data and have a null assumption that there is a mean zero difference between the data, therefore we are conducting a paired two sample test.
We must assume that there are no effects post hypnotism. Let  mu sub d  denote the difference in before and after pain measurements.
Let  mu sub d;  denote the difference in pain measurements.
Which of the following claim pairs matches the situation described?
We must assume that the treatment offered is worse for pain or has no effect, therefore the mean differences in pain measurements by default is greater than or equal to zero.

test statistic ; t is equal to; x sub d minus; mu sub d divided by; open paren; s sub d divided by s, q r t of n; close paren; ,  otherwise   known   a s   t h e,   quantity   mean   sample   difference   subtracted   b y   t h e,   population   mean   f o r,   t h e,   differences   divided   b y   t h e,   sample   standard   deviation   divided   b y   t h e,   square   root   o f   n .  Note   that   this   i s   a   t   distribution   with   degrees   o f   freedom   n; minus 1; .
We must know the mean (, x bar, sub d ) and standard deviation differences( s sub d ). Using a graphing calculator, the mean differences and the standard deviation of differences can be found in the STAT menu. The mean difference is found to be  3.125; .
With mean difference equalling ; 3.125 ,  s sub d =2.91143 ; open paren; t h e,   standard   deviation   o f   differences; close paren; ,  a n d,   n; is equal to; 8 ,  test   statistic   t; is equal to; 3.03591 .  Round   t o   four   decimal   places; 
Under the P-value table associated with ; t is equal to, 3.0359  and degrees of freedom equaling  8, plus 8 minus 2; is equal to; 14 , the  p, minus value  is found to be  0.00948; .
Since ; 0.00948 , the  p, minus value , is less than our significance level of  0.05; , the result is significant and we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference.

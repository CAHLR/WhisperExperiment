The inverse function theorem is that (f**(-1))'*(x)=1/(f'*(f**-1)*(x)).
To find the inverse of f(x) where ; a is equal to, 16  (remember that a is equal to the x-value of a point), then we need to first find what value of  x  when we plug it into f(x) will give us a value of  16 . In this case, it is when  x; is equal to; 1 , so we know that ; 16, f raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; is equal to 1; .
Next, to find the derivative of f(x), we can use the power rule. To do this, we can multiply the coefficient of each ; x  by its current exponent, and then subtract  1  from the exponent. Remember, constants become  0  when we take the derivative of a function and the derivative of tan(x) is  secant squared of x; .
Since we already found ; 16, f raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; is equal to, 1  and the derivative of f(x), then we can plug what we know into the inverse function theorem. Our resulting slope is  1 over 96; .

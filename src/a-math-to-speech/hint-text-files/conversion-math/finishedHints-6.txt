Locate the hundreds place in the number
What is the value of the hundreds place?
Check the next value to the right of thr indicated hundreds number
If the number to the right of the hundreds number is greater than or equal to  5  then add one to the hundreds place number and make everything after to 0s. If it is less than  5, , then leave the hundreds place number the same and change everything after to 0s.

The mean (also called the average) is formed by adding up all the data points and then divide by the total number of data points.
What is the total sum of all the data points?
How many total data points are there? In other words, how many numbers did you sum together in the last part?
What is the mean?
To find the median of a data set, we want to first determine the location of the median. Remember the formula for that data point is ; fraction, n plus 1, over 2, end fraction;  where  n;  represents the total number of data points in the set.
What is the location of the median? What is , fraction, n plus 1, over 2, end fraction; ?
Because the location of the median is  20.5; , this means we need to find the average between the 20th and 21st data points. Since the data is in order, we need to just find those two data points.

First, you should look at the box plot and understand the what the min and max values would indicate in the context of your example.
Secondly, you must look for an example that makes sense in the context. i.e. a maximum value of  150  would make it impossible for it to indicate hours of sleep per day.
First, find what percentage of data values fall in each interval that is clear. ; 38 minus 41  has 25%, and so does  41, minus 64  and  31, minus 38 . This means that less than 25% is between  31, minus 35; , making it the smallest interval.
First, you must find the skew of each box plot. Having more data on the left side means it is skewed right. More data on right side means skewed left.
In box plots, we are only given  5  key numbers, so we do not know the amount of people at each point on the graph. This means that we do not know the specific amount of people that have to more than  8,  foreign countries.
First, find the medians: China doesn't have a median while Germany has one at , 8  and the United States at  2 .  8  >  2;  so it is most likely that Germany travels more, but this dataset is too small for any conclusive claims.
First, you must look at where the first, second, and third quartiles are. The first is at , 0 , the second at  20 , and the third slightly before  100; .
Secondly, you must understand that to be close in a box plot means that the data in those quarties is similar as there is not much variation. If they are far apart, there is more variation.
First, you need to determine the shape of each box plot. All through tend to have more greater values which means they are all skewed right.
Secondly, you must understand what a right skew means in context. Here, it shows that the ages of the top 50% of buyers are more variable than the ages of the lower 50%.
Think about what properties of a box plot is affected by outliers. The box plot with the longest whisker will be most likely to have an outlier (BMW3).
First, you should look for the medians of each of the box plots and compare them in relation to each other. From this, we can see that the median of , 7  > median of  5  > median of  3, .
First, to pinpoint the smallest quarter, split the box plot into the  4  quarters based on the quartiles and end points and find the smallest one in length (2nd).
To find the spread of the 2nd quarter, calculate the difference between the first quartile and the median which is  3 .
First, to pinpoint the largest quarter, split the box plot into the  4  quarters based on the quartiles and end points and find the largest one in length (3rd).
To find the spread of the 3rd quarter, calculate the difference between the median and the third quartile which is  14 .
To calculate IQR, you must take the 3rd quartile and subtract eh 1st quartile. This results in ; 55  -  38  , is equal to   17; 
First look at where the intervals lie on the box plot. Here, these intervals are within a quarter so we cannot tell exactly where the data in the quarter is concentrated.

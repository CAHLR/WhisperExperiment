What should we set u equal to?
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads ; minus; the integral of u raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; d u; .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
As ; u is equal to; 1 plus, c o s x, , we will have upper and lower limits  x; is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to 2;  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply the whole integral by ; minus 1;  and interchange the limits.

Set ; u is equal to; 1 plus, e to the x-th  then  d u; is equal to, e to the x-th d x; 
What is the expression of the integral after using the u-substitution?
; the integral of fraction, u to the first, over 2, end fraction; d u; is equal to; fraction, fraction, u cubed, over 2, end fraction; over, 3 halves, end fraction; plus  cap c; is equal to; 2 thirds u raised to the 3 halves power; plus  cap c; 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable ; 2 thirds times; open paren, 1 plus e to the x-th, close paren raised to the 3 halves power; plus  cap c; 
We need to choose an appropriate u to perform substitution.
Which function should we set as 'u'?
Since ; u is equal to, 2 x cubed,  then  d u; is equal to, 6 x squared d x; 
As we've determined that du ; is equal to;   6 x squared,  dx, and the original function incorporates a factor of  3 x squared;  (rather than 6x**2), we need to make a minor adjustment to the constant multiplier to align it with the function we intend to substitute.
We can easily see that ; 3  is  1 half  of  6  so we will divide both side of the expression by  2  and obtain , fraction, d u, over 2, end fraction; is equal to, 3 x squared d x; 
; the integral of 3 x squared e squared x cubed d x; is equal to; open paren 1 divided by 2, close paren; times, the integral of e to the u-th d u; 
Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in ; x  back into the u integral: ; open paren 1 divided by 2, close paren; times, the integral of e to the u-th d u; is equal to, 1 half e to the u-th, plus  cap c; 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable ; 1 half, e raised to the 2 x cubed power; plus  cap c; 
Let ; u is equal to, 1 minus, x  so  d u; is equal to; negative 1 d x,  or  negative d u; is equal to d x; 
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x;  to u.

The new integral with a variable of u will be ; minus, the integral of e to the u-th d u,  as the limit goes from  u; is equal to 0  to  u, is equal to negative 1; 
; the integral of e to the u-th d u; is equal to, e to the u-th  as the limit goes from  u, is equal to, negative 1  to  u, is equal to, 0 . Note that the lower limit always has to be less than the upper limit. To change the order of limits, we multply the integral with  negative 1; .
; e to the 0 minus, e raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; is equal to; negative open paren, e raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; close paren; plus 1; 
Let ; u is equal to, 2 x  so  d u; is equal to, 2 d x;

What is the new lower limit in term of u?
What is the new upper limit in term of u?
The new integral with a variable of u will be ; the integral of e to the u-th d u,  as the limit goes from  u; is equal to 0  to  u, is equal to 4; 
; the integral of e to the u-th d u; is equal to, e to the u-th  as the limit goes from  u, is equal to 0  to  u, is equal to 4; 
; e to the fourth minus e to the 0; is equal to, e to the fourth minus 1; 
The first step is to convert the problem from words into mathematical expression. Since ; t  is an independent variable in this situation, we have to take the integral with respect to  t  instead of  x  as usual. We have , the integral of 3 to the t-th d t; 
; the integral of 3 to the t-th d t; is equal to; fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3, end fraction; plus  cap c; 
This is a time when the culture starts, we have ;  cap q of 0, is equal to 10 is equal to; fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3, end fraction; plus  cap c; 
Using basic algebra, what will C be? (Rounded to  2  decimal places)
The previous step gave us the expression ;  cap q of t, is equal to; fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3, end fraction; plus, 9.09 . We now find the ammount of bacteria as they increase in  2  hours by replace  t  with  2; .
What is the ammount of bacteria after  2  hours? (Rounded to  3,  decimal places)
; fraction, 3 squared, over, the natural log of, 3, end fraction; plus 9.09; is equal to 17.282; 
We can start by applying net change theorem then use u-substitution to solve for the integral.
; g of 10 minus g of 0; is equal to; the integral from 0 to 10 of; 2 e to the 0.02 t d t; . Note that  g of 0; is equal to 100;  is given
Add both sides by g(0) or ; 100  to obtain  g of 10, is equal to; 100 plus; the integral from 0 to 10 of; 2 e to the 0.02 t d t; 
; 100 plus, 2 over 0.02, e to the 0.02 t;  with the limit goes from  t; is equal to 0  to  t, is equal to 10; .
; 100 plus 100 e to the 0.2, minus 100; is equal to 122; 
This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of , x , then bring the  x squared;  in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent.
We have ; the integral from 1 to 2 of; fraction, e raised to the 1 over x, power; over, x squared, end fraction; d x; is equal to; the integral from 1 to 2 of; e raised to the x raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; end exponent; x raised to the open paren negative 2 close paren power; d x; 
Let ; u is equal to; x raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; , the exponent on e then  d u; is equal to; open paren; negative x raised to the open paren negative 2 close paren power; close paren; times d x;  or  negative d u; is equal to; x raised to the open paren negative 2 close paren power; d x; 
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads ; minus, the integral of e to the u-th d x; .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
With ; u is equal to; x raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power; , we will have upper and lower limits  x; is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to 1 half;  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by ; minus 1;  and interchange the limits.
; the integral from 1 half to 1 of; e to the u-th d u; is equal to, e to the u-th  with the limit goes from  u, is equal to, 1 half  to  u, is equal to 1; .
, e minus e raised to the 1 half power; 
First factor the ; 3  outside the integral symbol. Then use the , u raised to the open paren negative 1 close paren power;  rule. Thus, ; the integral of fraction, 3 over, x minus 10, end fraction; d x; is equal to; 3 times; the integral of fraction, 1 over, x minus 10, end fraction; d x; 
Set ; u is equal to, x minus, 10  then  d u; is equal to d x; 
; 3 times, the integral of 1 over u, d u; is equal to; 3 l n the absolute value of u; plus  cap c; 
As we set ; u is equal to; x minus; 10  at the beginning, we then obtain ; 3 l n, the absolute value of x minus 10, end absolute value; plus,  cap c  with  x  is different from  0; .

We know that the average amount of time that a running shoe lasts if used everyday lasts  18  months. We can use that value to predict the average amount of time needed to use up six shoes.
We can multiply , 18  months and  6  shoes to get the average amount of time to use up  6;  running shoes back to back everyday

The given average is , 18  days, divide  1  by  18;  to get the decay parameter
On the average, one pair of running shoes lasts  18  months if they are used every day. Multiply that average by the number of pairs that you want to calculate how long will last. Remember, a pair is two individual shoes.
Since we expect  30;  customers to arrive per hour (60 minutes), we expect on average one customer to arrive every two minutes on average.
We know that a customer arrives every two minutes. We can use that to estimate how many minutes it will take for three customers to arrive.
Since one customer arrives every two minutes on average, it will take six minutes on average for three customers to arrive.
By part a, we know that the average is ; 2  minutes between each customer.  1 over mean; is equal to, decay  parameter. The mean is  2;  minutes.

To do any calculations, you must know ; m , the decay parameter.  m, is equal to, 1 over mean, . It is given that the mean amount of days that travelers purchase their airline tickets is equal to  15;  days.
What is the value of  m ?
The probability desnsity function is ; f of x is equal to; m; e raised to the open paren negative m x, close paren power; , where e is the natural number  e; is equal to 2.7182818; dot; dot; .
To find the certain probability in an exponential distribution, set the random vairable ; x  to the desired probability condition: For example  f of 5, is equal to; m; e raised to the open paren negative 5 m, close paren power;  will yield the probability that a random trial yields  x; is equal to 5; .
We are trying to find the probability that travelers purchase their tickets fewer than ; 10  days in advance, we must find ;  cap p, open paren, x is less than 10, close paren; , so we may do  1; minus;  cap p, open paren x is equal to 1, close paren; minus;  cap p, open paren x is equal to 2, close paren; minus dot dot dot minus;  cap p, open paren x is equal to 10, close paren; , using  f of x; is equal to; m; e raised to the open paren negative m x, close paren power; , but to do it faster, we may use the CDF function to find the total area of the values that  x; is less than 10; .
Using CDF of X < , 10  and rounding to the nearest  3  decimals, we get  0.067; 
We want to find the corresponding  x  days value that 50% of travelers wait. One way of doing so would be using a PDF function on a calculator and inputting  0.5,  probability to yield the X value cutoff value for half of the exponential distribution curve.

To complete the square, we need to add a term to make the entire expression of the form ; a squared plus 2 a b, plus b squared; .
In this case, we want to add a term to ; 6 z squared, minus; z  to make it a perfect square. Assume  6 z squared,  is the  a squared  term and  negative z;  is the 2ab term.
What term should we add to both sides of the equation to make this true?

We can rewrite the expression as ; x squared plus x plus 10 x plus 10  or  x squared, plus x plus 10 x plus 10 . Let's factor  x squared, plus; x .  x  goes into both expressions, so let's rewrite this as , x, open paren x plus 1, close paren; . Now, factor  10 x; plus; 10 .  10  goes into both terms, so it is rewritten as , 10 times, open paren x plus 1, close paren; . Because both , x, open paren x plus 1, close paren;  and , 10 times, open paren x plus 1, close paren;  are multiplied by  x; plus; 1 , we can use the distributive property to rewrite the expression as ; open paren x plus 1, close paren; times, open paren x plus 10, close paren; .

We need to take our ; b  term and find the value we need to complete the square. , fraction, negative 6, over 2, end fraction; is equal to; negative 6 halves . Then, , open paren negative 6 halves close paren squared; is equal to, 36 over 4, , or  9; .

Notice that the traveler is disputing about the consistency of the average flight times, not the literal average.
Since the consistency of flight times is discussed, the variance is being disputed.
A sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Let s denote standard deviation. If s would be the standard deviation, what would be thte variance?
, s squared  is the variance, therefore the variance can be found by squaring the standard deviation, or the square of  15, .
The traveler is disputing the claim that the variance is  150 . The traveler collected their own data to test against the claim, therefore the traveler's claim is the alternative claim.
We have to be specific about the hypothesis when constructing tests so that we can get proper conclusions. Sometimes it can be hard to pin point the key alternative hypothesis like in this case because the traveler only "doubts" the claim which would lead us to believe that the alternative hypothesis would be that the variance isn't equal to  150 . However, the "no more than 150" claim by the airline is the most clear message that the null hypothesis is that the variance is less than or equal to  150; , therefore we should model our hypotheses off of airline's null claim.
When the alternative claim is that the test statistic is greater than the null value, then the test is a right tailed test.


Recall that the test statistic in a test of a single variance is test statistic ;  cap x squared is equal to; fraction, open paren n minus 1, close paren; times s squared, over, q squared, end fraction; . Note that  q squared;  here denotes the population variance whereas s denotes sample variance.
With n=25,q**2=150,s=15, ;  cap x squared is equal to; fraction, open paren 25 minus 1, close paren; times 15 squared, over 150, end fraction; .
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
Since the standard deviation is involved, this is a test of a single variance.
The observer's claim is that the standard deviation is less than six hits, which will be the alternate claim.
What the archer recorded in this case is assumed to be true as the observer is conducting the test to prove the archer wrong.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow   cap h sub 0; : q**2=6**2,H_a:q**2<6**2
Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.
The word 'less' in the claim that the archer's hits has less variation is the key determining factor to how we choose our test-we will be using a left tailed test.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).
The doctor is testing if the variances are different than what was originally thought, so this is a test of a single variance test.
The analyst's test result is higher than the claimed standard deviation. The analyst's claim is that the standard deviation is more than  12.2  percent, which will be the alternate claim.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow   cap h sub 0 : q**2=5**2,H_a:q**2>5**2
The test statistic formula is ;  cap x squared is equal to; fraction, open paren n minus 1, close paren; times s squared, over, q squared, end fraction; , where  q squared;  is population variance.
Let ;  cap x squared  denote the test statistic, s denote sample standard deviation, and q denote population standard deviation.   cap x squared; is equal to; fraction, open paren n minus 1, close paren; times s squared, over, q squared, end fraction; 
With ; n is equal to 15 ,  s, is equal to 13.2 , and  q, is equal to, 12.2 ,   cap x squared  is found to be  16.389; .
The analyst claims that the standard deviation is greater than what was reported.
The word "greater" in the claim that the broadband speed variation is greater than what was reported is the key determining factor to how we choose our test. Additionally, since the alternative claim has a "greater than" sign, we will be using a right tailed test.
The formula for degrees of freedom denoted by df is , d f is equal to n minus 1; .
We found that the test statistic is equal to ; 16.389 , so we can now find  p, minus; value  ;  cap p; open paren,  cap x squared is greater than 16.389; close paren; is equal to 0.2902; 
Since ; p minus value   0.2902; is greater than 0.05; , we fail to reject the null hypothesis and reject the alternate hypothesis by the analyst that the FCC reported the broadband speed standard deviation lower than the dataset really represents.
Degrees of freedom, often denoted as  d f; , are used to find critical cutoff values especially when performing inferential statistics.
Recall that degrees of freedom is k-1, where k is the population size.
What the math instructor in this case believes is assumed to be true as the student is conducting the test to prove the instructor wrong.
The student's claim is that the standard deviation is more than five points, which will be the alternate claim.
Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow   cap h sub 0 : q**2=5**2,H_a:q**2>5**2
Since the claim is that a single line causes less variation, this is a test of a single variance. The parameter is the population variance  q squared;  or the population standard deviation q.

The null claim is that time variations are the same as we are testing if there is greater variation in the waiting times of the single line.

Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.

What is the test type that will be used?
The word "less" in the claim that the claim that a single line causes less variation is the key determining factor to how we choose our test-we will be using a left tailed test.



\n##figure1.gif##
The , p minus value  is found to be  0.000042; , now compare that to our 5% level of significance to make a conclusion.
Since our significance level ; 0.05  is less than our  p, minus; value   0.000042 , we reject that the poulation variance is equal to  7.2 squared . We can interpret this as in that we do not think the variation in waiting times is  7.2;  minutes and rather think that the variation in waiting times is less.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).
The observer's claim is that the standard deviation is greater than  0.81 , which will be the alternate claim.
The prevailing belief is that the standard deviations are  0.81 , and the person conducting the test will test against that null claim.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow   cap h sub 0 : q**2=0.81**2,H_a:q**2>0.81**2

The region R between the graph of f(x) and the graph of g(x) over the interval [1,4]. The solid of revolution generated by revolving R around the y-axis.
Note that the axis of revolution is the y-axis, so the radius of a shell is given simply by ; x . We don’t need to make any adjustments to the  x, minus, term  of our integrand. The height of a shell, though, is given by  f of x, minus g of x; , so in this case we need to adjust the f(x) term of the integrand.

First, use a diagram such as the attached one to record the given information. It is also helpful to introduce a temporary variable, W, to represent the width of the garden and the length of the fence section parallel to the backyard fence.\n##figure1.gif##
We know we have only ; 80  feet of fence available, and   cap l, plus  cap w plus  cap l; is equal to; 80 , or more simply,  2  cap l; plus  cap w; is equal to, 80 . This allows us to represent the width, W, in terms of L with the equation   cap w, is equal to, 80 minus 2  cap l; .
We know the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, so ;  cap a is equal to,  cap l  cap w, is equal to;  cap l; open paren, 80 minus 2  cap l; close paren; is equal to; 80  cap l, minus 2  cap l squared; .
In general form, ;  cap a of  cap l, is equal to; negative 2  cap l squared, plus 80  cap l; 
The quadratic has a negative leading coefficient, so the graph will open downward, and the vertex will be the maximum value for the area. In finding the vertex, we must be careful because the equation is not written in standard polynomial form with decreasing powers. This is why we rewrote the function in general form for the last step. Since a is the coefficient of the squared term, ; a is equal to negative 2, comma, b is equal to 80 , and  v, is equal to 0; .
The x-coordinate is equal to , fraction, negative b, over 2, end fraction; a; .
Since ; b is equal to 80  and  a, is equal to negative 2; , what is the x-coordinate of the vertex?
Knowing that the x-coordinate of the vertex is  20 , what is the y-coordinate of the vertex?
The maximum value of the function is an area of ; 800  square feet, which occurs when   cap l, is equal to; 20  feet. When the shorter sides are  20  feet, there is  40  feet of fencing left for the longer side. To maximize the area, she should enclose the garden so the two shorter sides have length  20  feet and the longer side parallel to the existing fence has length  40;  feet.
Revenue is the amount of money a company brings in. In this case, the revenue can be found by multiplying the price per subscription times the number of subscribers, or quantity. We can introduce variables, ; p  for price per subscription and Q for quantity, giving us the equation  Revenue, is equal to p  cap q; .
Because the number of subscribers changes with the price, we need to find a relationship between the variables. We know that currently ; p is equal to 30 p is equal to, 30  and   cap q, is equal to 84; comma, 000.  cap q, is equal to 84; comma; 000 . We also know that if the price rises to $32, the newspaper would lose 5,000 subscribers, giving a second pair of values,  p, is equal to 32 p is equal to, 32  and   cap q, is equal to 79; comma, 000.  cap q, is equal to 79; comma 000; . From this we can find a linear equation relating the two quantities. The slope will be
The slope is equal to (79,000-84,000)/(32-30). What is the simplified answer for slope?
This tells us the paper will lose 2,500 subscribers for each dollar they raise the price. We can then solve for the y-intercept by subsituting in ;  cap q is equal to 84, comma, 000  and  p, is equal to 30; .
This gives us the linear equation Q=-2,500p+159,000 relating cost and subscribers. We now return to our revenue equation by plugging in the new formula for Q. The new equation is Revenue ; is equal to;  , negative 2500 p squared; plus 159000 p; 
To find the price that will maximize revenue for the newspaper, we can find the vertex.
What is the first coordinate of the vertex?
The model tells us that the maximum revenue will occur if the newspaper charges  dollars 31.80,  for a subscription. To find what the maximum revenue is, we evaluate the revenue function at the vertex.

Finally, set , f of x is equal to 0  and solve for the  x;  values.

First, augument the matrix with the first two columns. In other words, duplicate the first two columns, and add them to the end of the matrix.
Now, follow the formula to find the determinant. First, multiply the entries down from the row ; 1  column one spot, to the row  3  column  3  spot, in a diagonal fashion. Do this for the next two diagonals as well, from the row  1  column  2  spot, to the row  3  column  4  spot, and from the row  1  column  3  spot to the row  3  column  5;  spot.
Now, add all the previous products together. What do you get as your answer?
Next, multiply the values from the bottom left of the matrix to the location  3  spots to the top in a diagonal. Another way to see this is a diagonal from the bottom to the top. Do this for the next  2;  columns.
Now, subtract all the values that were just multiplied from the first set of diagonal multiplications(those that you calculated previously).
Therefore, the determinant is ; minus 1; .

Finding the determinant of a 2×2 matrix is straightforward, but finding the determinant of a 3×3 matrix is more complicated. One method is to augment the 3×3 matrix with a repetition of the first two columns, giving a 3×5 matrix. Then we calculate the sum of the products of entries down each of the three diagonals (upper left to lower right), and subtract the products of entries up each of the three diagonals (lower left to upper right). This is more easily understood with a visual and an example.\nFor a matrix ;  cap a is equal to; the 3 by 3 matrix; row 1; column 1; a sub 1, column 2; b sub 1, column 3; c sub 1; row 2; column 1; a sub 2, column 2; b sub 2, column 3; c sub 2; row 3; column 1; a sub 3, column 2; b sub 3, column 3; c sub 3; ,\n 1 . Augment A with the first  2  columns, det(A)=|(a_1,b_1,c_1),(a_2,b_2,c_2),(a_3,b_3,c_3)|(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),(a_3,b_3)|\n 2 . From upper left to lower right: Multiply the entries down the first diagonal. Add the result to the product of entries down the second diagonal. Add this result to the product of the entries down the third diagonal.\n 3 . From lower left to upper right: Subtract the product of entries up the first diagonal. From this result subtract the product of entries up the second diagonal. From this result, subtract the product of entries up the third diagonal.\nThe algebra is as follows:  determinant of  cap a; is equal to; a sub 1 b sub 2 c sub 3; plus, b sub 1 c sub 2 a sub 3; plus, c sub 1 a sub 2 b sub 3; minus, a sub 3 b sub 2 c sub 1; minus, b sub 3 c sub 2 a sub 1; minus, c sub 3 a sub 2 b sub 1; \n##figure1.gif##

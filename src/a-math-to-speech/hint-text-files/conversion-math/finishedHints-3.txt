There are two types of sampling that divide the population into groups of people: stratified and cluster. The difference between the two are that stratified sampling takes a proportionate number of subjects from each stratum to include into the sample while clustering usually means only a few clusters are selected to represent the entire population.
Does the instructor want to pick students from each group that they've created based on Lake Tahoe Community College math classes? Or do they only want one or two groups to be represented? If the instructor wants each Lake Tahoe Community College math class to be included in the sample select stratified. If the instructor only wants one or two groups to be represented in full, select cluster.
First, determine which rows from the table to look at. Since we want heights that are less than  65.95;  inches, we note that we want to only look at the first three rows because everything past that will have a larger height.
Now, knowing the frequency of each row, we can add up the first three rows. What is the sum?
The definition of a percentage is the proportion out of 100%. Since we know that there are ; 23  players out of a total of  100  players (the total of the frequency column) that are less than  65.95  inches tall, we can determine the percentage of players that is less than  65.95;  inches tall.

Notice that the traveler is disputing about the consistency of the average flight times, not the literal average.
Since the consistency of flight times is discussed, the variance is being disputed.
A sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Let s denote standard deviation. If s would be the standard deviation, what would be thte variance?
, s squared  is the variance, therefore the variance can be found by squaring the standard deviation, or the square of  15, .
The traveler is disputing the claim that the variance is  150 . The traveler collected their own data to test against the claim, therefore the traveler's claim is the alternative claim.
We have to be specific about the hypothesis when constructing tests so that we can get proper conclusions. Sometimes it can be hard to pin point the key alternative hypothesis like in this case because the traveler only "doubts" the claim which would lead us to believe that the alternative hypothesis would be that the variance isn't equal to  150 . However, the "no more than 150" claim by the airline is the most clear message that the null hypothesis is that the variance is less than or equal to  150; , therefore we should model our hypotheses off of airline's null claim.
When the alternative claim is that the test statistic is greater than the null value, then the test is a right tailed test.


Recall that the test statistic in a test of a single variance is test statistic ;  cap x squared is equal to; fraction, open paren n minus 1, close paren; times s squared, over, q squared, end fraction; . Note that  q squared;  here denotes the population variance whereas s denotes sample variance.
With n=25,q**2=150,s=15, ;  cap x squared is equal to; fraction, open paren 25 minus 1, close paren; times 15 squared, over 150, end fraction; .
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
Since the standard deviation is involved, this is a test of a single variance.
The observer's claim is that the standard deviation is less than six hits, which will be the alternate claim.
What the archer recorded in this case is assumed to be true as the observer is conducting the test to prove the archer wrong.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow   cap h sub 0; : q**2=6**2,H_a:q**2<6**2
Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.
The word 'less' in the claim that the archer's hits has less variation is the key determining factor to how we choose our test-we will be using a left tailed test.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).
The doctor is testing if the variances are different than what was originally thought, so this is a test of a single variance test.
The analyst's test result is higher than the claimed standard deviation. The analyst's claim is that the standard deviation is more than  12.2  percent, which will be the alternate claim.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow   cap h sub 0 : q**2=5**2,H_a:q**2>5**2
The test statistic formula is ;  cap x squared is equal to; fraction, open paren n minus 1, close paren; times s squared, over, q squared, end fraction; , where  q squared;  is population variance.
Let ;  cap x squared  denote the test statistic, s denote sample standard deviation, and q denote population standard deviation.   cap x squared; is equal to; fraction, open paren n minus 1, close paren; times s squared, over, q squared, end fraction; 
With ; n is equal to 15 ,  s, is equal to 13.2 , and  q, is equal to, 12.2 ,   cap x squared  is found to be  16.389; .
The analyst claims that the standard deviation is greater than what was reported.
The word "greater" in the claim that the broadband speed variation is greater than what was reported is the key determining factor to how we choose our test. Additionally, since the alternative claim has a "greater than" sign, we will be using a right tailed test.
The formula for degrees of freedom denoted by df is , d f is equal to n minus 1; .
We found that the test statistic is equal to ; 16.389 , so we can now find  p, minus; value  ;  cap p; open paren,  cap x squared is greater than 16.389; close paren; is equal to 0.2902; 
Since ; p minus value   0.2902; is greater than 0.05; , we fail to reject the null hypothesis and reject the alternate hypothesis by the analyst that the FCC reported the broadband speed standard deviation lower than the dataset really represents.
Degrees of freedom, often denoted as  d f; , are used to find critical cutoff values especially when performing inferential statistics.
Recall that degrees of freedom is k-1, where k is the population size.
What the math instructor in this case believes is assumed to be true as the student is conducting the test to prove the instructor wrong.
The student's claim is that the standard deviation is more than five points, which will be the alternate claim.
Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow   cap h sub 0 : q**2=5**2,H_a:q**2>5**2
Since the claim is that a single line causes less variation, this is a test of a single variance. The parameter is the population variance  q squared;  or the population standard deviation q.

The null claim is that time variations are the same as we are testing if there is greater variation in the waiting times of the single line.

Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.

What is the test type that will be used?
The word "less" in the claim that the claim that a single line causes less variation is the key determining factor to how we choose our test-we will be using a left tailed test.

The , p minus value  is found to be  0.000042; , now compare that to our 5% level of significance to make a conclusion.
Since our significance level ; 0.05  is less than our  p, minus; value   0.000042 , we reject that the poulation variance is equal to  7.2 squared . We can interpret this as in that we do not think the variation in waiting times is  7.2;  minutes and rather think that the variation in waiting times is less.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).
The observer's claim is that the standard deviation is greater than  0.81 , which will be the alternate claim.
The prevailing belief is that the standard deviations are  0.81 , and the person conducting the test will test against that null claim.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow   cap h sub 0 : q**2=0.81**2,H_a:q**2>0.81**2

First, use a diagram such as the attached one to record the given information. It is also helpful to introduce a temporary variable, W, to represent the width of the garden and the length of the fence section parallel to the backyard fence.\n##figure1.gif##
We know we have only ; 80  feet of fence available, and   cap l, plus  cap w plus  cap l; is equal to; 80 , or more simply,  2  cap l; plus  cap w; is equal to, 80 . This allows us to represent the width, W, in terms of L with the equation   cap w, is equal to, 80 minus 2  cap l; .
We know the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, so ;  cap a is equal to,  cap l  cap w, is equal to;  cap l; open paren, 80 minus 2  cap l; close paren; is equal to; 80  cap l, minus 2  cap l squared; .
In general form, ;  cap a of  cap l, is equal to; negative 2  cap l squared, plus 80  cap l; 
The quadratic has a negative leading coefficient, so the graph will open downward, and the vertex will be the maximum value for the area. In finding the vertex, we must be careful because the equation is not written in standard polynomial form with decreasing powers. This is why we rewrote the function in general form for the last step. Since a is the coefficient of the squared term, ; a is equal to negative 2, comma, b is equal to 80 , and  v, is equal to 0; .
The x-coordinate is equal to , fraction, negative b, over 2, end fraction; a; .
Since ; b is equal to 80  and  a, is equal to negative 2; , what is the x-coordinate of the vertex?
Knowing that the x-coordinate of the vertex is  20 , what is the y-coordinate of the vertex?
The maximum value of the function is an area of ; 800  square feet, which occurs when   cap l, is equal to; 20  feet. When the shorter sides are  20  feet, there is  40  feet of fencing left for the longer side. To maximize the area, she should enclose the garden so the two shorter sides have length  20  feet and the longer side parallel to the existing fence has length  40;  feet.
Revenue is the amount of money a company brings in. In this case, the revenue can be found by multiplying the price per subscription times the number of subscribers, or quantity. We can introduce variables, ; p  for price per subscription and Q for quantity, giving us the equation  Revenue, is equal to p  cap q; .
Because the number of subscribers changes with the price, we need to find a relationship between the variables. We know that currently ; p is equal to 30 p is equal to, 30  and   cap q, is equal to 84; comma, 000.  cap q, is equal to 84; comma; 000 . We also know that if the price rises to $32, the newspaper would lose 5,000 subscribers, giving a second pair of values,  p, is equal to 32 p is equal to, 32  and   cap q, is equal to 79; comma, 000.  cap q, is equal to 79; comma 000; . From this we can find a linear equation relating the two quantities. The slope will be
The slope is equal to (79,000-84,000)/(32-30). What is the simplified answer for slope?
This tells us the paper will lose 2,500 subscribers for each dollar they raise the price. We can then solve for the y-intercept by subsituting in ;  cap q is equal to 84, comma, 000  and  p, is equal to 30; .
This gives us the linear equation Q=-2,500p+159,000 relating cost and subscribers. We now return to our revenue equation by plugging in the new formula for Q. The new equation is Revenue ; is equal to;  , negative 2500 p squared; plus 159000 p; 
To find the price that will maximize revenue for the newspaper, we can find the vertex.
What is the first coordinate of the vertex?
The model tells us that the maximum revenue will occur if the newspaper charges  dollars 31.80,  for a subscription. To find what the maximum revenue is, we evaluate the revenue function at the vertex.

Finding the determinant of a 2Ã—2 matrix is straightforward, but finding the determinant of a 3Ã—3 matrix is more complicated. One method is to augment the 3Ã—3 matrix with a repetition of the first two columns, giving a 3Ã—5 matrix.

First, augument the matrix with the first two columns. In other words, duplicate the first two columns, and add them to the end of the matrix.
Now, follow the formula to find the determinant. First, multiply the entries down from the row ; 1  column one spot, to the row  3  column  3  spot, in a diagonal fashion. Do this for the next two diagonals as well, from the row  1  column  2  spot, to the row  3  column  4  spot, and from the row  1  column  3  spot to the row  3  column  5;  spot.
Now, add all the previous products together. What do you get as your answer?
Next, multiply the values from the bottom left of the matrix to the location  3  spots to the top in a diagonal. Another way to see this is a diagonal from the bottom to the top. Do this for the next  2;  columns.
Now, subtract all the values that were just multiplied from the first set of diagonal multiplications(those that you calculated previously).
Therefore, the determinant is ; minus 1; .

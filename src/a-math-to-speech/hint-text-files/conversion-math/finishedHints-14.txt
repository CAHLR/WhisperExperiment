By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same, the F statistic is ; fraction, s sub 1 squared, over, s sub 2 squared, end fraction; , where s would denote the sample variance.
Instructor 1's variance is , 52.3 , and instructor 2's variance is  89.9, . divide instructor 1's variance with instructor 2's variance.
,  cap f is equal to 52.3 over 89.9; 
Since the alternative claim is that instructor 1's grade variances are less than that of instructor  2 , the test will be left tailed.
In a hypothesis test, a ; p minus, value  lower than the significance level means that the null hypothesis is rejected. With a 10% of significance converted to  0.10 , the significance level is higher than the  p; minus value  of  0.0753; .
The bikers are interested in whether or not the variances are the same. This indicates that a two tailed test is being performed.
Variances will be compared. Variances are squares of the standard deviation.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same, let s denote the standard deviations. The F statistic is ; fraction, s sub 1 squared, over, s sub 2 squared, end fraction; .
Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let ; sigma times times 2 sub 1; and \sigma**{2}_{2}  b e   t h e,   population   variances   a n d,  , s times times 2 sub 1, and s**{2}_{1}  b e   t h e,   sample   variances .   cap l e t,   t h e,   sample   sizes   b e   n sub 1   a n d, .  sub 2 .  Since   w e   a r e,   interested   i n   comparing   t h e,   t w o,   sample   variances ,  w e   u s e,   t h e,    cap f   ratio :   cap f  ; is equal to;  \dfrac{\left[\dfrac{(s_{1})**{2}}{(\sigma_{1})**{2}}\right]}{\left[\dfrac{(s_{2})**{2}}{(\sigma_{2})**{2}}\right]}
Given the variances, we can take the square root of each of them to find the standard deviation, and thereafterwards divide them by each other to get our F statistic.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same. Let s denote the standard deviations. The F statistic is ; fraction, s sub 1 squared, over, s sub 2 squared, end fraction; .
By ; fraction, 38.1 squared, over, 22.5 squared, end fraction; , the F statistic is  2.8674; 
Student 1's standard deviation is , 38.1 , and student 2's standard deviation is  22.5, . Divide student 1's variance with student 2's variance.
Let the variance of students ; 1  and  2  equal  sigma sub 1 and \sigma_2  respectively .   cap t h e,   students   a r e,   concerned   with   variation   o f   grade   results ,  therefore   a   test   o f   t w o,   variances   will   b e   performed; .
If the second student thinks that he is more consistent, then that signals that his variance in grades is smaller than the first student. Let that claim be the alternative hypothesis.
The students are interested if there is variation between their grades or not, therefore the null hypothesis is that their variations are the same approximately.
Let T1 ; is equal to,  tenor  1 , and B2 , is equal to;  bass  2 . The standard deviations of the samples are , s sub  cap t 1 end sub; is equal to, 3.3302  and , s sub  cap b 2 end sub; is equal to 2.7208;  after inputting the data into separate groups of Bass and Tenor men.
Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed.
By default, the height variances are equal to each other, and the challenging statement that motivates the test is that the variance of heights go up with lower voices. It's hard to form an alternative hypothesis inequality statement off of this, so formulate the hypotheses based off of the base question if the variance of the heights of the singers of the two groups are different from each other.
State the null and alternative hypotheses. Let ; sigma times times 2 sub T1; denote Tenor 1 singers and \sigma**{2}_{\text{B2}}  denote   Bass   2   players; .
If the key motivation behind the test is finding a difference in variances, then the alternative hypothesis is that the variances of the two groups concerned aren't equal to each other.
What is the F statistic? Round to four decimal places/
Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let ; sigma times times 2 sub 1; and \sigma**{2}_{2}  b e   t h e,   population   variances   a n d,  , s times times 2 sub 1, and s**{2}_{1}  b e   t h e,   sample   variances .   cap l e t,   t h e,   sample   sizes   b e   n sub 1   a n d, .  sub 2 .

Calculate the F statistic by squaring each of the standard deviations and dividing the tenor group by the bass group squared standard deviations. Remember to round to four decimal places.
The F statistic is ; 1.4894  with  20  and  25  degrees of freedom for Tenor  1  and Bass  2;  respectively.
Another of the uses of the F distribution is testing two variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages. For instance, college administrators would like two college professors grading exams to have the same variation in their grading. In order for a lid to fit a container, the variation in the lid and the container should be the same. A supermarket might be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers.
In order to perform a F test of two variances, since the test in equality is very sensitive to deviation compared to other tests used, the populations must be consistent.
Since a test in two variances is very sensitive to deviations from normality, what would be a good assumption to make?
If the test is sensitive to deviations from normality, then the two populations being tested from which the two samples will be drawn should be normally distributed.

When performing a test of two variances (or frankly most tests), we don't want our results to be affected by any other confounding variables.
Since we don't want to get our results messed up by external factors or data relation to each other, what would be a good assumption to ensure an efficient test of two variances?
Given the options listed, the best way to reduce confounding factors is to ensure that the two populations are independent of each other so that misleading correlations are avoided.
Let the variance of workers ; 1  and  2  equal  sigma sub 1 and \sigma_2  respectively .   cap t h e,   workers   a r e,   concerned   with   variation   o f   commute   times ,  therefore   a   test   o f   t w o,   variances   will   b e   performed; .
If the first worker thinks that he is more consistent, then that signals that his variance in time to commute to work is smaller than the second worker. Let that claim be the alternative hypothesis.
By default, since the workers commute at the same place in the same distances, the variances will be equal to each other.
Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed.
We are given the sample variances. The variances are the standard deviations squared.
With the variance of worker , 1  being  12.1 , the sample standard deviation would be the square root of  12.1; .

The boxes represent the quartiles: the first box goes from the first quartile to the second quartile and the second box goes from the second quartile to the third quartile. The whiskers represent the remaining data (the 25% of the data that is less than the first quartile and the 25% of the data greater than the third quartile).
As children are defined as age  17  and under while senior citizens are age  65;  and over, are children and seniors represented as boxes or whiskers?

What percentage of the U.S. population is children?
Does the right whisker (age  50;  and older) include other age groups except seniors?
What percentage of the U.S. population is seniors?
If there are other people also part of the whisker, which contains 25% of the data point, this means that the population of seniors does not take up the entire whisker. If a whisker contains 25% of the data, does this mean that seniors make up 25% of the data, <25% of the data, or >25% of the data?
Are there fewer or more children than senior citizens?
Is "25%" > "less than 25%"?
The complement rule essentially explains that the proportion of the survey that answered "not sure" is equivalent to ; 1  (or 100%) minus the sum of all the relative frequencies of those who answered in the table.

Linear Regression is the process of finding the line that best fits the data on the plot.
The number to the second power is always a positive numebr.
If , r   is equal to   negative 1; , there is perfect negative correlation.
The slope of the best-fit line tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (x) variable, on average.
; r squared , when expressed as a percent, represents the percent of variation in the dependent (predicted) variable  y  that can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable  x  using the regression ; open paren; b e s t, minus f i t; close paren;  line.
If , r   is equal to   1; , there is perfect positive correlation. However, there is not enough of data points to support to show that there is a strong positive correlation between the data sets.
The sum of the squared error is the sum of absolute value of a residual errors.
The criteria for the best fit line is that the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized, that is, made as small as possible.
The correlation coefficient is calculated as below, where , n   is equal to,  the number of data points.\n##figure1.gif##
If you suspect a linear relationship between , x  and  y , then  r,  can measure how strong the linear relationship is.
If , r   is equal to   1; , there is perfect positive correlation.
If , r   is equal to   negative 1; , there is perfect negative correlation
The sign of  r  is the same as the sign of the slope,  b, , of the best-fit line.
The sign of  r  is the same as the sign of the slope,  b, , of the best-fit line.
Strong correlation does not suggest that , x  causes  y  or  y  causes  x; . We say "correlation does not imply causation."
; r squared  ythat can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable  x  using the regression ; open paren; b e s t, minus f i t; close paren;  line.
If ; r   is equal to,   0  there is likely no linear correlation. It is important to view the scatterplot, however, because data that exhibit a curved or horizontal pattern may have a correlation of  0; .

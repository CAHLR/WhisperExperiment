We can rewrite the expression as ; x squared plus x plus 10 x plus 10  or  x squared, plus x plus 10 x plus 10 . Let's factor  x squared, plus; x .  x  goes into both expressions, so let's rewrite this as , x, open paren x plus 1, close paren; . Now, factor  10 x; plus; 10 .  10  goes into both terms, so it is rewritten as , 10 times, open paren x plus 1, close paren; . Because both , x, open paren x plus 1, close paren;  and , 10 times, open paren x plus 1, close paren;  are multiplied by  x; plus; 1 , we can use the distributive property to rewrite the expression as ; open paren x plus 1, close paren; times, open paren x plus 10, close paren; .

Write the inequality as one quotient on the left and zero on the right.
Determine the critical points—the points where the rational expression will be zero or undefined.
When is the equation undefine? Note that the equation is undefined when the denominator equal to zero.
Solve the equation , x plus 4, is equal to 0 . What is the value of  x; ?
When does the equation equal zero? Note that the equation is undefined when the numerator equal to zero.
Solve the equation , x minus 3, is equal to 0 . What is the value of  x; ?
Given that the ; x is equal to 3  and  x, is equal to; negative 4  are the two critical points, we can divide the number line into three intervals, namely, , the open interval from negative infinity to negative 4; , , open paren, negative 4 comma 3, close paren;  and , the open interval from 3 to infinity; .
To find the sign of each factor in an interval, we choose any point in that interval and use it as a test point. Any point in the interval will give the expression the same sign, so we can choose any point in the interval.
For the interval ; the open interval from negative infinity to negative 4; , take the point  x; is equal to; negative 5  within the interval and plug it into the original expression. What is the value of ; fraction, x minus 3, over, x plus 4, end fraction;  after plugging in the value  x; is equal to negative 5; ?
Since ; 8  is a positive numer greater than  0 , we get the sign of quotient is positive in the interval , the open interval from negative infinity to negative 4; .

We get , fraction, negative 3, over 4, end fraction;  after plugging in  x; is equal to; 0  into the quotient ; fraction, x minus 3, over, x plus 4, end fraction; . , fraction, negative 3, over 4, end fraction;  is a negative number, so we can mark the quotient negative in the interval , open paren, negative 4 comma 3, close paren; .
For the interval ; the open interval from 3 to infinity; , take the point  x; is equal to; 4  within the interval and plug it into the original expression ; fraction, x minus 3, over, x plus 4, end fraction; . We get  1 eighth  after plugging in  x; is equal to; 4  into the quotient ; fraction, x minus 3, over, x plus 4, end fraction; .  1 eighth  is a positive number, so we can mark the quotient positive in the interval , the open interval from 3 to infinity; .
We want the quotient to be greater than or equal to zero, so the numbers in the intervals ; the open interval from negative infinity to negative 4;  and , the open interval from 3 to infinity;  are solutions.
The critical point ; x is equal to, negative 4  makes the denominator  0 , so it must be excluded from the solution and we mark it with a parenthesis.\nThe critical point  x; is equal to, 3  makes the whole rational expression  0 . The inequality requires that the rational expression be greater than or equal to  0 . So,  3;  is part of the solution and we will mark it with a bracket.
We know that ; the open interval from negative infinity to 4; , , the open interval from 3 to infinity,  and  x; is equal to 3;  are the answer, please use "[ ]". "( )" and U to write it in a mathematical form.
Write the inequality as one quotient on the left and zero on the right.
By subtracting ; 2  to get zero on the right, we get ; fraction, 6 x, over, x minus 6, end fraction; minus 2; is greater than 0; 
LCD for ; fraction, 6 x, over, x minus 6, end fraction;  and  2  is , open paren x minus 6, close paren; , we can rewrite  2  as ; fraction, 2 times, open paren x minus 6, close paren, over, x minus 6, end fraction; . We can rewrite ; fraction, 6 x, over, x minus 6, end fraction; minus; 2  as ; fraction, 6 x, over, x minus 6, end fraction; minus; fraction, 2 times, open paren x minus 6, close paren, over, x minus 6, end fraction; .
By subtracting the numerators and placing the difference over the common denominator, we can rewrite ((6*x)/(x-6))-(2(x-6)/(x-6))) as ; fraction, 6 x minus, 2 times, open paren x minus 6, close paren, over, x minus 6, end fraction; .
; fraction, 6 x minus, 2 times, open paren x minus 6, close paren, over, x minus 6, end fraction; is equal to; fraction, 4 x plus 12, over, x minus 6, end fraction; 
Determine the critical points—the points where the rational expression will be zero or undefined.

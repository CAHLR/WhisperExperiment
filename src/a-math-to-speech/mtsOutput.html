If both the $$x$$ and the $$y$$ values or an equation are squared, the equation is not a parabola.
P in this case is $$1$$. Since the form of the parabola is $$y=4{px}^2$$, the equation should specify $$p$$.
The answer is $$y=4\left(1\right) x^2$$
If both the $$x$$ and the $$y$$ values or an equation are squared, the equation is not a parabola.
Therefore, since both the $$x$$ and $$y$$ values are squared, the equation is not a parabola.
If both the $$x$$ and the $$y$$ values or an equation are squared, the equation is not a parabola.
Therefore, the equation is not a parabola.
You can determine the answer to this by plugging in points. Create an equation and plug in points to see where the graph is going.
The equation can be $$y=-4\left(1\right) x^2$$.
Substitute $$x=0$$, $$-1$$, and $$1$$ into the equation. Where does the graph go? Is it opening down or up?
The equation opens down.
The focus has the form (0,p), so the equation will have the form $$x^2=4py$$.
Now, solve for $$4p$$. This can be done by finding $$p$$ and multiplying by $$4$$.
Finally, plug $$4p$$ into the $$x^2=4py$$ equation. What is the final equation?(do not simplify your answer)
Therefore, the final answer is $$x^2=14y$$.
Find $$p$$ by using the form $$y^2=4px$$. Solve for $$p$$. What is it?
The coordinates of the focuse are (p,0). Use this to find the focus.
Therefore, the answer is $$(6,0)$$.
Find $$p$$ by using the form $$y^2=4px$$. Solve for $$p$$. What is it?
The equation of the directrix is $$x=-p$$. Use this to find the directrix.
Therefore, the answer is $$x=-6$$.
The endpoints of the latus rectum have the same x-coordinate at the focus.
Plug $$x$$ $$=6$$ into the original equation to find the $$y$$ coordinates of the endpoints of the equation. Submit your answer as $$2$$ coordinate pairs.
Therefore, the answer is $$(6,12)$$ and $$(6,-12)$$.
The standard form of this equation is $${\left(y-k\right)}^2=4p(x-h)$$.
The vertex of this type of equation is (h,k).
Now, using the standard form and your knowledge of the vertex, what is the answer?
Therefore, the answer is $$(-3,1)$$
The axis of symmetry of the equation is $$y=k$$.
What is k in this equation?
Therefore, the axis of symmetry is $$y=1$$.
The equation for a directrix in standard form is $$x=h-p$$.
$$h$$ in this case is $$-3$$, while $$p$$ is $$-4$$. This can be found in the original equation, which is in the form: $${\left(y-k\right)}^2=4p(x-h)$$.
Given $$h$$ and $$p$$, what is the directrix?
Therefore, the directrix is $$x=1$$.
The form of the endpoints of the latus rectum is: (h+p,k+2p),(h+p,k-2p).
Plug in the values for the endpoints, using the the proper $$h$$, k, and $$p$$ values.
What are the endpoints? Use the given formula.
Therefore, the endpoints are $$(-7,7)$$ and $$(-7,9)$$.
We simply have to divide both sides by $$8$$ to get $$\frac{x}{8}=y^2$$
We know from the equation that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$, and that $$p=\frac{1}{32}$$. This means that that the directrix is $$x=\frac{-1}{32}$$ and the focus is $$(\frac{1}{32},0)$$
We just have to multiply by $$4$$ on both sides to get $$4y=x^2$$
From the equation, we can see that $$p=1$$, and the vertex is $$(0,0)$$. Because $$p=1$$, we know that the focus is $$(0,1)$$ and the directrix is $$y=-1$$
We can divide both sides by $$-4$$ to put the equation in standard form. We now have $$\frac{-y}{4}=x^2$$
From the equation, we can see that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$. Because we know that $$p=\frac{-1}{16}$$, we know that the focus is $$(0,\frac{-1}{16})$$ and the directrix is $$y=\frac{1}{16}$$
To put the parabola in standard form, we can simply multiply both sides by $$8$$ to get $$8x=y^2$$
From the equation, we know that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$ and that $$p=2$$. This means that the focus is $$(2,0)$$ and the directrix is $$x=-2$$
We can divide both sides by $$36$$ to get $$\frac{x}{36}=y^2$$
From the equation, we know that $$p=\frac{1}{144}$$. This means that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$, the focus is $$(\frac{1}{144},0)$$ and the directrix is $$x=\frac{-1}{144}$$
We can write this parabola in standard form by multiplying both sides by $$36$$ to get $$36x=y^2$$
From the equation, we know that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$ and that $$p=9$$. This means that the focus is $$(9,0)$$ and the directrix is $$x=-9$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(1,1)$$ and that $$p=1$$. This means that the focus is $$(1,2)$$ and the directrix is $$y=0$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-4,2)$$ and that $$p=\frac{1}{5}$$. This means that the focus is $$(-4+\frac{1}{5},2)$$ and the directrix is $$x=-4-\frac{1}{5}$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-3,4)$$ and that $$p=\frac{1}{2}$$. This means that the focus is $$(-2.5, 4)$$ and the directrix is $$x=-3.5$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-1,4)$$ and $$p=\frac{1}{2}$$. This means that the focus is $$(-1, 4.5)$$ and the directrix is $$y=3.5$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-4,-1)$$ and that $$p=6$$. This means that the focus is $$(-4,5)$$ and that the directrix is $$y=-7$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-4,-4)$$ and $$p=4$$. This means that the focus is $$(-4,0)$$ and that the directrix is $$x=-8$$
We must first put this parabola into standard form by multiplying both sides by $$8$$ to get $$8x=y^2$$. From this, we know that $$p=2$$ and the vertex is $$(0,0)$$. This means that the focus is $$(2,0)$$ and that the directrix is $$x=-2$$
Setting $$u=-x$$, and then $$du=-1dx$$. Multiply the du equation by $$-1$$, so now you have $$dx=-du$$
$$\int e^{-x} \,dx=-\int e^x \,dx$$
What is the result of the integration?
As we set $$u=-x$$ at the beginning, we then obtain $$-\left(e^{\left(-x\right)}\right)+C$$
Starting by setting $$u=x+2$$ then $$du=dx$$.
$$\int \frac{1}{u} \,du=ln|u|+C$$
Plug $$x+2$$ back into u to obtain $$ln|x+2|+C$$
Rewritting the expression will make it more convenient to use u-substitution. This can be rewritten as $$\int \left(2x^3+3x\right) {\left(x^4+3x^2\right)}^{-1} \,dx$$
What should we set u equal to?
As we set $$u=x^4+3x^2$$ then $$du=\left(4x^3+6x\right) dx$$.
Alter du by factoring out the $$2$$ to obtain $$du=2\left(2x^3+3x\right) dx$$.
Dividing both side by $$2$$ to obtain $$\frac{du}{2}=\left(2x^3+3x\right) dx$$
Rewite an integrand in u: $$(1/2)*\int u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du$$
$$(1/2)*\int u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du=\frac{1}{2} ln|u|+C$$
$$\frac{1}{2} ln|x^4+3x^2|+C$$
An ideal strategy is to select "u" as a function and its derivative that appears within the integral.
What should we set u equal to?
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads $$-\int u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du$$.
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from $$x$$ to u.
As $$u=1+cosx$$, we will have upper and lower limits $$x=1$$ and $$x=2$$ respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply the whole integral by $$-1$$ and interchange the limits.
$$-\int_{2}^{1} u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du=\int_{1}^{2} u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du$$
$$\int_{1}^{2} u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du=ln|u|$$ with the limit goes from $$u=1$$ to $$u=2$$
$$ln2-ln1=ln2$$
Set $$u=2x$$ then $$du=2dx$$
$$\int e^u \,du$$
$$e^u+C$$
$$e^{2x}+C$$
As a property of integral, the constant $$2$$ can be moved out of the integrand which left $$(1/2)*\int \frac{1}{x} \,dx$$
$$\frac{1}{2} ln|x|+C$$
Set $$u=lnx$$ then $$du=\frac{1}{x} dx$$.
$$\int u^{\left(-2\right)} \,du$$
$$\int u^{\left(-2\right)} \,du=-\left(u^{\left(-1\right)}\right)+C$$
$$\frac{-1}{ln}|x|+C$$
First rewrite the problem using a rational exponent: $$\int e^x \sqrt{1+e^x} \,dx=\int \frac{e^x {\left(1+e^x\right)}^1}{2} \,dx$$
Set $$u=1+e^x$$ then $$du=e^x dx$$
What is the expression of the integral after using the u-substitution?
$$\int \frac{u^1}{2} \,du=\frac{\frac{u^3}{2}}{\frac{3}{2}}+C=\frac{2}{3} u^{\frac{3}{2}}+C$$
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable $$\frac{2}{3} {\left(1+e^x\right)}^{\frac{3}{2}}+C$$
We need to choose an appropriate u to perform substitution.
Which function should we set as 'u'?
Since $$u=2x^3$$ then $$du=6x^2 dx$$
As we've determined that du $$=$$ $$6x^2$$ dx, and the original function incorporates a factor of $$3x^2$$ (rather than 6x**2), we need to make a minor adjustment to the constant multiplier to align it with the function we intend to substitute.
We can easily see that $$3$$ is $$\frac{1}{2}$$ of $$6$$ so we will divide both side of the expression by $$2$$ and obtain $$\frac{du}{2}=3x^2 dx$$
$$\int 3x^2 e^2 x^3 \,dx=(1/2)*\int e^u \,du$$
Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in $$x$$ back into the u integral: $$(1/2)*\int e^u \,du=\frac{1}{2} e^u+C$$
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable $$\frac{1}{2} e^{2x^3}+C$$
Let $$u=1-x$$ so $$du=-1dx$$ or $$-du=dx$$
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from $$x$$ to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?
What is the new upper limit in term of u?
The new integral with a variable of u will be $$-\int e^u \,du$$ as the limit goes from $$u=0$$ to $$u=-1$$
$$\int e^u \,du=e^u$$ as the limit goes from $$u=-1$$ to $$u=0$$. Note that the lower limit always has to be less than the upper limit. To change the order of limits, we multply the integral with $$-1$$.
$$e^0-e^{\left(-1\right)}=-\left(e^{\left(-1\right)}\right)+1$$
Let $$u=2x$$ so $$du=2dx$$
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from $$x$$ to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?
What is the new upper limit in term of u?
The new integral with a variable of u will be $$\int e^u \,du$$ as the limit goes from $$u=0$$ to $$u=4$$
$$\int e^u \,du=e^u$$ as the limit goes from $$u=0$$ to $$u=4$$
$$e^4-e^0=e^4-1$$
The first step is to convert the problem from words into mathematical expression. Since $$t$$ is an independent variable in this situation, we have to take the integral with respect to $$t$$ instead of $$x$$ as usual. We have $$\int 3^t \,dt$$
$$\int 3^t \,dt=\frac{3^t}{\ln(3)}+C$$
This is a time when the culture starts, we have $$Q(0)=10=\frac{3^t}{\ln(3)}+C$$
Using basic algebra, what will C be? (Rounded to $$2$$ decimal places)
The previous step gave us the expression $$Q(t)=\frac{3^t}{\ln(3)}+9.09$$. We now find the ammount of bacteria as they increase in $$2$$ hours by replace $$t$$ with $$2$$.
What is the ammount of bacteria after $$2$$ hours? (Rounded to $$3$$ decimal places)
$$\frac{3^2}{\ln(3)}+9.09=17.282$$
We can start by applying net change theorem then use u-substitution to solve for the integral.
$$g(10)-g(0)=\int_{0}^{10} 2e^{0.02} t \,dt$$. Note that $$g(0)=100$$ is given
Add both sides by g(0) or $$100$$ to obtain $$g(10)=100+\int_{0}^{10} 2e^{0.02} t \,dt$$
$$100+\frac{2}{0.02} e^{0.02} t$$ with the limit goes from $$t=0$$ to $$t=10$$.
$$100+100e^{0.2}-100=122$$
This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of $$x$$, then bring the $$x^2$$ in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent.
We have $$\int_{1}^{2} \frac{e^{\frac{1}{x}}}{x^2} \,dx=\int_{1}^{2} e^{x^{\left(-1\right)}} x^{\left(-2\right)} \,dx$$
Let $$u=x^{\left(-1\right)}$$, the exponent on e then $$du=\left(-x^{\left(-2\right)}\right) dx$$ or $$-du=x^{\left(-2\right)} dx$$
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads $$-\int e^u \,dx$$.
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from $$x$$ to u.
With $$u=x^{\left(-1\right)}$$, we will have upper and lower limits $$x=1$$ and $$x=\frac{1}{2}$$ respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by $$-1$$ and interchange the limits.
$$\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{1} e^u \,du=e^u$$ with the limit goes from $$u=\frac{1}{2}$$ to $$u=1$$.
$$e-e^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
First factor the $$3$$ outside the integral symbol. Then use the $$u^{\left(-1\right)}$$ rule. Thus, $$\int \frac{3}{x-10} \,dx=3*\int \frac{1}{x-10} \,dx$$
Set $$u=x-10$$ then $$du=dx$$
$$3*\int \frac{1}{u} \,du=3ln|u|+C$$
As we set $$u=x-10$$ at the beginning, we then obtain $$3ln|x-10|+C$$ with $$x$$ is different from $$0$$.

The first step is to combine the terms containing $$x^3$$.
How can we combine the $$x^3$$ coefficients?
Since our only $$x^3$$ terms is $$4x^3$$, this is the most simplified version of $$x^3$$.
Next, we can combine the terms with $$x^2$$.
How can we simplify the $$2x$$ coefficients?
Our $$x^2$$ terms are $$12x^2$$ and $$8x^2$$. We can simplify the $$x^2$$ terms by adding the coefficients.
What is $$12x^2+8x^2$$?
Now we can simplify the $$x$$ terms.
What is the simplified version of the $$x$$ terms?
The $$x$$ terms are $$9x$$ and $$-5x$$. We can simplify the $$x$$ terms by adding the coefficients.
What is $$9x-5x$$?
The last part we need to simplify is the constants. The constants in this expression are $$-21$$ and $$20$$. By adding these integers, we will have the simplified term.
What is $$-21+20$$?
How do we format the new expression?
Since there are no more terms to simplify, we can write the expression as the sum of the simplified terms: $$4x^3+20x^2+4x-1$$.
This expression is in the form of $${\left(a-b\right)}^2$$. $${\left(a-b\right)}^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$$
Let $$4x=a$$ and let $$1=b$$. What is $${\left(4x-1\right)}^2$$?
This expression is in the form of $$\left(a+b\right) \left(a-b\right)$$. $$\left(a+b\right) \left(a-b\right)$$ $$=$$ $$a^2-b^2$$
Let a $$=$$ $$9x$$ and $$b$$ $$=$$ $$4$$. What is $$\left(9x+4\right) \left(9x-4\right)$$?
The first step is to use the distributive property. $$\left(x+4\right) \left(3x-2y+5\right)$$ $$=$$ $$x\left(3x-2y+5\right)+4\left(3x-2y+5\right)$$
The next step is to multiply those terms. $$x\left(3x-2y+5\right)+4\left(3x-2y+5\right)$$ $$=$$ $$3x^2-2xy+5x+12x-8y+20$$
After you multiply, in order to simplify, you need to combine like terms. $$3x^2-2xy+5x+12x-8y+20$$ $$=$$ $$3x^2-2xy+5x+12x-8y+20$$
Finally, you need to simplify. $$3x^2-2xy+5x+12x-8y+20$$ $$=$$ $$3x^2-2xy+17x-8y+20$$
The first step is to use the distributive property. $$\left(3x-1\right) \left(2x+7y-9\right)$$ $$=$$ $$3x\left(2x+7y-9\right)-1\left(2x+7y-9\right)$$
The next step is to multiply those terms. $$3x\left(2x+7y-9\right)-1\left(2x+7y-9\right)=$$ $$6x^2+21x-27x-2x-7y+9$$
After you multiply, in order to simplify, you need to combine like terms. $$6x^2+21xy-27x-2x-7y+9$$ $$=$$ $$6x^2+21xy-27x+2x-7y+9$$
Finally, you need to simplify. $$6x^2+21xy-27x+2x-7y+9$$ $$=$$ $$6x^2+21xy-29x-7y+9$$
The first step is to distribute the negative sign to remove parentheses. $$12x^2+3x-8x^2-19$$ $$=$$ $$12x^2+3x-8x^2+19$$
The next step is to group like terms. $$12x^2+3x-8x^2+19$$ $$=$$ $$12x^2-8x^2+3x+19$$
Finally, simplify the expression. $$12x^2-8x^2+3x+19$$ $$=$$ $$4x^2+3x+19$$
The first step is to distribute the negative sign to remove parentheses. $$6w^2+24w+24-3w^2-6w+3$$ $$=$$ $$6w^2+24w+24-3w^2+6w-3$$
The next step is to group like terms. $$6w^2+24w+24-3w^2+6w-3$$ $$=$$ $$6w^2-3w^2+24w+6w+24-3$$
Finally, simplify the expression. $$6w^2-3w^2+24w+6w+24-3$$ $$=$$ $$3w^2+30w+21$$
In this problem you are subtracting one expression from another, so use the distributive property to distribute the negative sign.

The first step is to simplify the $$x^3$$ term. However, since, $$2x^3$$ is the only $$x^3$$ term in the expression, this term stays the same.
The next step is to simplify the $$x^2$$ term.
We simplify the $$x^2$$ term by combining the coefficients of the values with $$x^2$$. The coefficients with $$x^2$$ are $$5x^2$$ and $$2x^2$$. By adding these values, we simplify the $$x^2$$ term.
What is $$5x^2+2x^2$$?
Now we need to combine the terms with $$x$$ by adding $$-x$$ and $$-3x$$.
What is $$-x+\left(-3x\right)$$?

The slope of a line can be determined using two points $$(x_1,y_1)$$, $$(x_2,y_2)$$ by subtracting the y-values over the x-values: $$\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$.
Substituting the points $$(-3,2)$$, $$(5,-2)$$, the slope is equal to $$\frac{\left(-2-2\right)}{5-\left(-3\right)}$$
What is $$-2-2$$?
What is $$5-(-3)$$?
$$\frac{-4}{8}$$ can be simplified to get the slope of the line: $$\frac{-1}{2}$$.
The point slope formula can be used to get the function of a line through the given point: $$y-y_1=m \left(x-x_1\right)$$ where $$m$$ is the slope and $$(x_1,y_1)$$ is the point.
Substituing $$m=\frac{-1}{2}$$ and $$(-3,2)$$ for the point, the formula is equal to $$y-2=-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(x+3\right)$$.
Distribute $$\frac{-1}{2}$$ to $$x+3$$. What is $$3-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$$?
Add $$2$$ from the left to get $$y=-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) x-\frac{3}{2}+2$$.
What is $$\frac{-3}{2}+2$$?
The x-intercept can be found by plugging in $$y=0$$ for the formula and solving for $$x$$.
Plugging in $$y=0$$ means $$0=-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) x+\frac{1}{2}$$
Subtract $$\frac{1}{2}$$ from the right to get $$\frac{-1}{2}=-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) x$$.
Divide $$\frac{-1}{2}$$ on both sides to isolate 'x'.
What is $$\frac{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)}$$?
For some value a, $$f(x-a)$$ means that f(x) is translated to the right by a units. Similarly, $$f{\left(x+a\right)}$$ means that f(x) is translated to the left by a units.
Since a is $$-2$$, $$f{\left(x+2\right)}$$ means that the graph is translated left by $$2$$.
For some value a not equal to $$0$$, $$a f{\left(x\right)}$$ means that f(x) is stretched vertically by a. Similarly, $$\frac{f{\left(x\right)}}{a}$$ means that f(x) is compressed vertically by a.
Since a is $$3$$, $$3f{\left(x+2\right)}$$ means that the graph is stretched vertically by $$3$$.
For some value a, $$f{\left(x\right)}+a$$ means that f(x) is translated up by a units. Similarly, $$f(x)-a$$ means that f(x) is translated down by a units.
Since a is $$-5$$, $$3f{\left(x+2\right)}-5$$ means that the graph is translated down by $$5$$.

For a conic with a focus at the origin, if the directrix is $$x=p$$ or $$x=-p$$, where $$p$$ is a positive real number, and the eccentricity is a positive real number e, the conic has a polar equation\n$$r=\frac{e p}{1+e cos\left(\theta\right)}$$ or $$r=\frac{e p}{1-e cos\left(\theta\right)}$$\nFor a conic with a focus at the origin, if the directrix is $$y=p$$ or $$y=-p$$, where $$p$$ is a positive real number, and the eccentricity is a positive real number e, the conic has a polar equation\n$$r=\frac{e p}{1+e sin\left(\theta\right)}$$ or $$r=\frac{e p}{1-e sin\left(\theta\right)}$$
We want to multiply the numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of the constant of the original equation, $$\frac{1}{c}$$, where c is the constant so that we can change the equation to the standard polar form. What is the reciprocal that we want to multiply?
After multiplying by the reciprocal of the constant, what is the polar equation now?
In the standard polar form, the coefficient in front of $$sin\left(\theta\right)$$ or $$cos\left(\theta\right)$$ is the eccentricity. What is the eccentricity?
Since $$sin\left(\theta\right)$$ is in the denominator, is the directrix along the $$y$$ or $$x$$ axis?
The numerator is the product of the eccentricity and the directrix. Now that we know the eccentricity and numerator, what is the directrix?

Rewrite the equation in standard form which has a $$1$$ as the constant in the denominator. Achieve standard form by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of the constant of the original equation, $$\frac{1}{4}$$.
Given the standard form is $$r=\frac{ep}{1\pm ecostheta}$$, identify the eccentricity (e).

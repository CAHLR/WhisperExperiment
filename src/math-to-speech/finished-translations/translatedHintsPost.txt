An ideal strategy is to select "u" as a function and its derivative that appears within the integral.
What should we set u equal to?
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads  minus the integral of u raised to the  negative 1  power d u .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
As  u is equal to 1 plus, c o s x, , we will have upper and lower limits  x is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to 2  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply the whole integral by  minus 1  and interchange the limits.
 minus the integral from 2 to 1 of u raised to the  negative 1  power d u is equal to the integral from 1 to 2 of u raised to the  negative 1  power d u

 the integral of fraction, u to the first, over 2,  d u is equal to fraction, fraction, u cubed, over 2,  over, 3 halves,  plus   c is equal to 2 thirds u raised to the 3 halves power plus   c 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable  2 thirds times , 1 plus e to the x-th,  raised to the 3 halves power plus   c 
We need to choose an appropriate u to perform substitution.
Which function should we set as 'u'?
Since  u is equal to, 2 x cubed,  then  d u is equal to, 6 x squared d x 
As we've determined that du  is equal to   6 x squared,  dx, and the original function incorporates a factor of  3 x squared  (rather than 6x**2), we need to make a minor adjustment to the constant multiplier to align it with the function we intend to substitute.
We can easily see that  3  is  1 half  of  6  so we will divide both side of the expression by  2  and obtain , fraction, d u, over 2,  is equal to, 3 x squared d x 
 the integral of 3 x squared e squared x cubed d x is equal to  1 divided by 2,  times, the integral of e to the u-th d u 
Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in  x  back into the u integral:   1 divided by 2,  times, the integral of e to the u-th d u is equal to, 1 half e to the u-th, plus   c 
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable  1 half, e raised to the 2 x cubed power plus   c 
Let  u is equal to, 1 minus, x  so  d u is equal to negative 1 d x,  or  negative d u is equal to d x 
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?

Let  u is equal to, 2 x  so  d u is equal to, 2 d x 
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?
What is the new upper limit in term of u?
The new integral with a variable of u will be  the integral of e to the u-th d u,  as the limit goes from  u is equal to 0  to  u, is equal to 4 
 the integral of e to the u-th d u is equal to, e to the u-th  as the limit goes from  u, is equal to 0  to  u, is equal to 4 
 e to the fourth minus e to the 0 is equal to, e to the fourth minus 1 
The first step is to convert the problem from words into mathematical expression. Since  t  is an independent variable in this situation, we have to take the integral with respect to  t  instead of  x  as usual. We have , the integral of 3 to the t-th d t 
 the integral of 3 to the t-th d t is equal to fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3,  plus   c 
This is a time when the culture starts, we have    q of 0, is equal to 10 is equal to fraction, 3 to the t-th, over, the natural log of, 3,  plus   c

What is the ammount of bacteria after  2  hours? (Rounded to  3,  decimal places)
 fraction, 3 squared, over, the natural log of, 3,  plus 9.09 is equal to 17.282 
We can start by applying net change theorem then use u-substitution to solve for the integral.
 g of 10 minus g of 0 is equal to the integral from 0 to 10 of 2 e to the 0.02 t d t . Note that  g of 0 is equal to 100  is given
Add both sides by g(0) or  100  to obtain  g of 10, is equal to 100 plus the integral from 0 to 10 of 2 e to the 0.02 t d t 
 100 plus, 2 over 0.02, e to the 0.02 t  with the limit goes from  t is equal to 0  to  t, is equal to 10 .
 100 plus 100 e to the 0.2, minus 100 is equal to 122 
This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of , x , then bring the  x squared  in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent.
We have  the integral from 1 to 2 of fraction, e raised to the 1 over x, power over, x squared,  d x is equal to the integral from 1 to 2 of e raised to the x raised to the  negative 1  power end exponent x raised to the  negative 2  power d x 
Let  u is equal to x raised to the  negative 1  power , the exponent on e then  d u is equal to  negative x raised to the  negative 2  power  times d x  or  negative d u is equal to x raised to the  negative 2  power d x 
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads  minus, the integral of e to the u-th d x .
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from  x  to u.
With  u is equal to x raised to the  negative 1  power , we will have upper and lower limits  x is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to 1 half  respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by  minus 1  and interchange the limits.
 the integral from 1 half to 1 of e to the u-th d u is equal to, e to the u-th  with the limit goes from  u, is equal to, 1 half  to  u, is equal to 1 .
, e minus e raised to the 1 half power 
First factor the  3  outside the integral symbol. Then use the , u raised to the  negative 1  power  rule. Thus,  the integral of fraction, 3 over, x minus 10,  d x is equal to 3 times the integral of fraction, 1 over, x minus 10,  d x 
Set  u is equal to, x minus, 10  then  d u is equal to d x

We can eliminate the fraction by multiplying the denominator across both sides of the equation
We can distribute the  r  that was initially on the LHS into the (1+2*cos(\theta))) that was multiplied to the LHS.
We want to isolate the , r  terms that are not associated multiplied to a trigonometric function. We do so by subtracting , 2 rcos of theta  across both sides.

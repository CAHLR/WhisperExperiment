The equation can be $$y=-4\left(1\right) x^2$$.
Substitute $$x=0$$, $$-1$$, and $$1$$ into the equation. Where does the graph go? Is it opening down or up?
The equation opens down.
The focus has the form (0,p), so the equation will have the form $$x^2=4py$$.
Now, solve for $$4p$$. This can be done by finding $$p$$ and multiplying by $$4$$.
Finally, plug $$4p$$ into the $$x^2=4py$$ equation. What is the final equation?(do not simplify your answer)
Therefore, the final answer is $$x^2=14y$$.
Find $$p$$ by using the form $$y^2=4px$$. Solve for $$p$$. What is it?
The coordinates of the focuse are (p,0). Use this to find the focus.
Therefore, the answer is $$(6,0)$$.
Find $$p$$ by using the form $$y^2=4px$$. Solve for $$p$$. What is it?
The equation of the directrix is $$x=-p$$. Use this to find the directrix.
Therefore, the answer is $$x=-6$$.
The endpoints of the latus rectum have the same x-coordinate at the focus.
Plug $$x$$ $$=6$$ into the original equation to find the $$y$$ coordinates of the endpoints of the equation. Submit your answer as $$2$$ coordinate pairs.
Therefore, the answer is $$(6,12)$$ and $$(6,-12)$$.
The standard form of this equation is $${\left(y-k\right)}^2=4p(x-h)$$.
The vertex of this type of equation is (h,k).
Now, using the standard form and your knowledge of the vertex, what is the answer?
Therefore, the answer is $$(-3,1)$$
The axis of symmetry of the equation is $$y=k$$.
What is k in this equation?
Therefore, the axis of symmetry is $$y=1$$.
The equation for a directrix in standard form is $$x=h-p$$.
$$h$$ in this case is $$-3$$, while $$p$$ is $$-4$$. This can be found in the original equation, which is in the form: $${\left(y-k\right)}^2=4p(x-h)$$.
Given $$h$$ and $$p$$, what is the directrix?
Therefore, the directrix is $$x=1$$.
The form of the endpoints of the latus rectum is: (h+p,k+2p),(h+p,k-2p).
Plug in the values for the endpoints, using the the proper $$h$$, k, and $$p$$ values.
What are the endpoints? Use the given formula.
Therefore, the endpoints are $$(-7,7)$$ and $$(-7,9)$$.
We simply have to divide both sides by $$8$$ to get $$\frac{x}{8}=y^2$$
We know from the equation that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$, and that $$p=\frac{1}{32}$$. This means that that the directrix is $$x=\frac{-1}{32}$$ and the focus is $$(\frac{1}{32},0)$$
We just have to multiply by $$4$$ on both sides to get $$4y=x^2$$
From the equation, we can see that $$p=1$$, and the vertex is $$(0,0)$$. Because $$p=1$$, we know that the focus is $$(0,1)$$ and the directrix is $$y=-1$$
We can divide both sides by $$-4$$ to put the equation in standard form. We now have $$\frac{-y}{4}=x^2$$
From the equation, we can see that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$. Because we know that $$p=\frac{-1}{16}$$, we know that the focus is $$(0,\frac{-1}{16})$$ and the directrix is $$y=\frac{1}{16}$$
To put the parabola in standard form, we can simply multiply both sides by $$8$$ to get $$8x=y^2$$
From the equation, we know that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$ and that $$p=2$$. This means that the focus is $$(2,0)$$ and the directrix is $$x=-2$$
We can divide both sides by $$36$$ to get $$\frac{x}{36}=y^2$$
From the equation, we know that $$p=\frac{1}{144}$$. This means that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$, the focus is $$(\frac{1}{144},0)$$ and the directrix is $$x=\frac{-1}{144}$$
We can write this parabola in standard form by multiplying both sides by $$36$$ to get $$36x=y^2$$
From the equation, we know that the vertex is $$(0,0)$$ and that $$p=9$$. This means that the focus is $$(9,0)$$ and the directrix is $$x=-9$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(1,1)$$ and that $$p=1$$. This means that the focus is $$(1,2)$$ and the directrix is $$y=0$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-4,2)$$ and that $$p=\frac{1}{5}$$. This means that the focus is $$(-4+\frac{1}{5},2)$$ and the directrix is $$x=-4-\frac{1}{5}$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-3,4)$$ and that $$p=\frac{1}{2}$$. This means that the focus is $$(-2.5, 4)$$ and the directrix is $$x=-3.5$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-1,4)$$ and $$p=\frac{1}{2}$$. This means that the focus is $$(-1, 4.5)$$ and the directrix is $$y=3.5$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-4,-1)$$ and that $$p=6$$. This means that the focus is $$(-4,5)$$ and that the directrix is $$y=-7$$
Since this parabola is already in standard form, we know that the vertex is $$(-4,-4)$$ and $$p=4$$. This means that the focus is $$(-4,0)$$ and that the directrix is $$x=-8$$
We must first put this parabola into standard form by multiplying both sides by $$8$$ to get $$8x=y^2$$. From this, we know that $$p=2$$ and the vertex is $$(0,0)$$. This means that the focus is $$(2,0)$$ and that the directrix is $$x=-2$$
Setting $$u=-x$$, and then $$du=-1dx$$. Multiply the du equation by $$-1$$, so now you have $$dx=-du$$
$$\int e^{-x} \,dx=-\int e^x \,dx$$
What is the result of the integration?
As we set $$u=-x$$ at the beginning, we then obtain $$-\left(e^{\left(-x\right)}\right)+C$$
Starting by setting $$u=x+2$$ then $$du=dx$$.
$$\int \frac{1}{u} \,du=ln|u|+C$$
Plug $$x+2$$ back into u to obtain $$ln|x+2|+C$$
Rewritting the expression will make it more convenient to use u-substitution. This can be rewritten as $$\int \left(2x^3+3x\right) {\left(x^4+3x^2\right)}^{-1} \,dx$$
What should we set u equal to?
As we set $$u=x^4+3x^2$$ then $$du=\left(4x^3+6x\right) dx$$.
Alter du by factoring out the $$2$$ to obtain $$du=2\left(2x^3+3x\right) dx$$.
Dividing both side by $$2$$ to obtain $$\frac{du}{2}=\left(2x^3+3x\right) dx$$
Rewite an integrand in u: $$(1/2)*\int u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du$$
$$(1/2)*\int u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du=\frac{1}{2} ln|u|+C$$
$$\frac{1}{2} ln|x^4+3x^2|+C$$
An ideal strategy is to select "u" as a function and its derivative that appears within the integral.
What should we set u equal to?
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads $$-\int u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du$$.
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from $$x$$ to u.
As $$u=1+cosx$$, we will have upper and lower limits $$x=1$$ and $$x=2$$ respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply the whole integral by $$-1$$ and interchange the limits.
$$-\int_{2}^{1} u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du=\int_{1}^{2} u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du$$
$$\int_{1}^{2} u^{\left(-1\right)} \,du=ln|u|$$ with the limit goes from $$u=1$$ to $$u=2$$
$$ln2-ln1=ln2$$
Set $$u=2x$$ then $$du=2dx$$
$$\int e^u \,du$$
$$e^u+C$$
$$e^{2x}+C$$
As a property of integral, the constant $$2$$ can be moved out of the integrand which left $$(1/2)*\int \frac{1}{x} \,dx$$
$$\frac{1}{2} ln|x|+C$$
Set $$u=lnx$$ then $$du=\frac{1}{x} dx$$.
$$\int u^{\left(-2\right)} \,du$$
$$\int u^{\left(-2\right)} \,du=-\left(u^{\left(-1\right)}\right)+C$$
$$\frac{-1}{ln}|x|+C$$
First rewrite the problem using a rational exponent: $$\int e^x \sqrt{1+e^x} \,dx=\int \frac{e^x {\left(1+e^x\right)}^1}{2} \,dx$$
Set $$u=1+e^x$$ then $$du=e^x dx$$
What is the expression of the integral after using the u-substitution?
$$\int \frac{u^1}{2} \,du=\frac{\frac{u^3}{2}}{\frac{3}{2}}+C=\frac{2}{3} u^{\frac{3}{2}}+C$$
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable $$\frac{2}{3} {\left(1+e^x\right)}^{\frac{3}{2}}+C$$
We need to choose an appropriate u to perform substitution.
Which function should we set as 'u'?
Since $$u=2x^3$$ then $$du=6x^2 dx$$
As we've determined that du $$=$$ $$6x^2$$ dx, and the original function incorporates a factor of $$3x^2$$ (rather than 6x**2), we need to make a minor adjustment to the constant multiplier to align it with the function we intend to substitute.
We can easily see that $$3$$ is $$\frac{1}{2}$$ of $$6$$ so we will divide both side of the expression by $$2$$ and obtain $$\frac{du}{2}=3x^2 dx$$
$$\int 3x^2 e^2 x^3 \,dx=(1/2)*\int e^u \,du$$
Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in $$x$$ back into the u integral: $$(1/2)*\int e^u \,du=\frac{1}{2} e^u+C$$
The final step is to convert u back into the original variable $$\frac{1}{2} e^{2x^3}+C$$
Let $$u=1-x$$ so $$du=-1dx$$ or $$-du=dx$$
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from $$x$$ to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?
What is the new upper limit in term of u?
The new integral with a variable of u will be $$-\int e^u \,du$$ as the limit goes from $$u=0$$ to $$u=-1$$
$$\int e^u \,du=e^u$$ as the limit goes from $$u=-1$$ to $$u=0$$. Note that the lower limit always has to be less than the upper limit. To change the order of limits, we multply the integral with $$-1$$.
$$e^0-e^{\left(-1\right)}=-\left(e^{\left(-1\right)}\right)+1$$
Let $$u=2x$$ so $$du=2dx$$
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from $$x$$ to u.
What is the new lower limit in term of u?
What is the new upper limit in term of u?
The new integral with a variable of u will be $$\int e^u \,du$$ as the limit goes from $$u=0$$ to $$u=4$$
$$\int e^u \,du=e^u$$ as the limit goes from $$u=0$$ to $$u=4$$
$$e^4-e^0=e^4-1$$
The first step is to convert the problem from words into mathematical expression. Since $$t$$ is an independent variable in this situation, we have to take the integral with respect to $$t$$ instead of $$x$$ as usual. We have $$\int 3^t \,dt$$
$$\int 3^t \,dt=\frac{3^t}{\ln(3)}+C$$
This is a time when the culture starts, we have $$Q(0)=10=\frac{3^t}{\ln(3)}+C$$
Using basic algebra, what will C be? (Rounded to $$2$$ decimal places)
The previous step gave us the expression $$Q(t)=\frac{3^t}{\ln(3)}+9.09$$. We now find the ammount of bacteria as they increase in $$2$$ hours by replace $$t$$ with $$2$$.
What is the ammount of bacteria after $$2$$ hours? (Rounded to $$3$$ decimal places)
$$\frac{3^2}{\ln(3)}+9.09=17.282$$
We can start by applying net change theorem then use u-substitution to solve for the integral.
$$g(10)-g(0)=\int_{0}^{10} 2e^{0.02} t \,dt$$. Note that $$g(0)=100$$ is given
Add both sides by g(0) or $$100$$ to obtain $$g(10)=100+\int_{0}^{10} 2e^{0.02} t \,dt$$
$$100+\frac{2}{0.02} e^{0.02} t$$ with the limit goes from $$t=0$$ to $$t=10$$.
$$100+100e^{0.2}-100=122$$
This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of $$x$$, then bring the $$x^2$$ in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent.
We have $$\int_{1}^{2} \frac{e^{\frac{1}{x}}}{x^2} \,dx=\int_{1}^{2} e^{x^{\left(-1\right)}} x^{\left(-2\right)} \,dx$$
Let $$u=x^{\left(-1\right)}$$, the exponent on e then $$du=\left(-x^{\left(-2\right)}\right) dx$$ or $$-du=x^{\left(-2\right)} dx$$
Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads $$-\int e^u \,dx$$.
After setting f(x) to f(u), you need to change the limits of integration because the variable of integration has changed from $$x$$ to u.
With $$u=x^{\left(-1\right)}$$, we will have upper and lower limits $$x=1$$ and $$x=\frac{1}{2}$$ respectively.
Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by $$-1$$ and interchange the limits.
$$\int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{1} e^u \,du=e^u$$ with the limit goes from $$u=\frac{1}{2}$$ to $$u=1$$.
$$e-e^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
First factor the $$3$$ outside the integral symbol. Then use the $$u^{\left(-1\right)}$$ rule. Thus, $$\int \frac{3}{x-10} \,dx=3*\int \frac{1}{x-10} \,dx$$
Set $$u=x-10$$ then $$du=dx$$
$$3*\int \frac{1}{u} \,du=3ln|u|+C$$
As we set $$u=x-10$$ at the beginning, we then obtain $$3ln|x-10|+C$$ with $$x$$ is different from $$0$$.

The first step is to combine the terms containing $$x^3$$.
How can we combine the $$x^3$$ coefficients?
Since our only $$x^3$$ terms is $$4x^3$$, this is the most simplified version of $$x^3$$.
Next, we can combine the terms with $$x^2$$.
How can we simplify the $$2x$$ coefficients?
Our $$x^2$$ terms are $$12x^2$$ and $$8x^2$$. We can simplify the $$x^2$$ terms by adding the coefficients.
What is $$12x^2+8x^2$$?
Now we can simplify the $$x$$ terms.
What is the simplified version of the $$x$$ terms?
The $$x$$ terms are $$9x$$ and $$-5x$$. We can simplify the $$x$$ terms by adding the coefficients.
What is $$9x-5x$$?
The last part we need to simplify is the constants. The constants in this expression are $$-21$$ and $$20$$. By adding these integers, we will have the simplified term.
What is $$-21+20$$?
How do we format the new expression?
Since there are no more terms to simplify, we can write the expression as the sum of the simplified terms: $$4x^3+20x^2+4x-1$$.
This expression is in the form of $${\left(a-b\right)}^2$$. $${\left(a-b\right)}^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$$
Let $$4x=a$$ and let $$1=b$$. What is $${\left(4x-1\right)}^2$$?
This expression is in the form of $$\left(a+b\right) \left(a-b\right)$$. $$\left(a+b\right) \left(a-b\right)$$ $$=$$ $$a^2-b^2$$
Let a $$=$$ $$9x$$ and $$b$$ $$=$$ $$4$$. What is $$\left(9x+4\right) \left(9x-4\right)$$?
The first step is to use the distributive property. $$\left(x+4\right) \left(3x-2y+5\right)$$ $$=$$ $$x\left(3x-2y+5\right)+4\left(3x-2y+5\right)$$
The next step is to multiply those terms. $$x\left(3x-2y+5\right)+4\left(3x-2y+5\right)$$ $$=$$ $$3x^2-2xy+5x+12x-8y+20$$
After you multiply, in order to simplify, you need to combine like terms. $$3x^2-2xy+5x+12x-8y+20$$ $$=$$ $$3x^2-2xy+5x+12x-8y+20$$
Finally, you need to simplify. $$3x^2-2xy+5x+12x-8y+20$$ $$=$$ $$3x^2-2xy+17x-8y+20$$
The first step is to use the distributive property. $$\left(3x-1\right) \left(2x+7y-9\right)$$ $$=$$ $$3x\left(2x+7y-9\right)-1\left(2x+7y-9\right)$$
The next step is to multiply those terms. $$3x\left(2x+7y-9\right)-1\left(2x+7y-9\right)=$$ $$6x^2+21x-27x-2x-7y+9$$
After you multiply, in order to simplify, you need to combine like terms. $$6x^2+21xy-27x-2x-7y+9$$ $$=$$ $$6x^2+21xy-27x+2x-7y+9$$
Finally, you need to simplify. $$6x^2+21xy-27x+2x-7y+9$$ $$=$$ $$6x^2+21xy-29x-7y+9$$
The first step is to distribute the negative sign to remove parentheses. $$12x^2+3x-8x^2-19$$ $$=$$ $$12x^2+3x-8x^2+19$$
The next step is to group like terms. $$12x^2+3x-8x^2+19$$ $$=$$ $$12x^2-8x^2+3x+19$$
Finally, simplify the expression. $$12x^2-8x^2+3x+19$$ $$=$$ $$4x^2+3x+19$$
The first step is to distribute the negative sign to remove parentheses. $$6w^2+24w+24-3w^2-6w+3$$ $$=$$ $$6w^2+24w+24-3w^2+6w-3$$
The next step is to group like terms. $$6w^2+24w+24-3w^2+6w-3$$ $$=$$ $$6w^2-3w^2+24w+6w+24-3$$
Finally, simplify the expression. $$6w^2-3w^2+24w+6w+24-3$$ $$=$$ $$3w^2+30w+21$$
In this problem you are subtracting one expression from another, so use the distributive property to distribute the negative sign.

The first step is to simplify the $$x^3$$ term. However, since, $$2x^3$$ is the only $$x^3$$ term in the expression, this term stays the same.
The next step is to simplify the $$x^2$$ term.
We simplify the $$x^2$$ term by combining the coefficients of the values with $$x^2$$. The coefficients with $$x^2$$ are $$5x^2$$ and $$2x^2$$. By adding these values, we simplify the $$x^2$$ term.
What is $$5x^2+2x^2$$?
Now we need to combine the terms with $$x$$ by adding $$-x$$ and $$-3x$$.
What is $$-x+\left(-3x\right)$$?

Substituing $$m=\frac{-1}{2}$$ and $$(-3,2)$$ for the point, the formula is equal to $$y-2=-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(x+3\right)$$.
Distribute $$\frac{-1}{2}$$ to $$x+3$$. What is $$3-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$$?
Add $$2$$ from the left to get $$y=-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) x-\frac{3}{2}+2$$.
What is $$\frac{-3}{2}+2$$?
The x-intercept can be found by plugging in $$y=0$$ for the formula and solving for $$x$$.
Plugging in $$y=0$$ means $$0=-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) x+\frac{1}{2}$$
Subtract $$\frac{1}{2}$$ from the right to get $$\frac{-1}{2}=-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) x$$.
Divide $$\frac{-1}{2}$$ on both sides to isolate 'x'.
What is $$\frac{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)}$$?
For some value a, $$f(x-a)$$ means that f(x) is translated to the right by a units. Similarly, $$f{\left(x+a\right)}$$ means that f(x) is translated to the left by a units.
Since a is $$-2$$, $$f{\left(x+2\right)}$$ means that the graph is translated left by $$2$$.
For some value a not equal to $$0$$, $$a f{\left(x\right)}$$ means that f(x) is stretched vertically by a. Similarly, $$\frac{f{\left(x\right)}}{a}$$ means that f(x) is compressed vertically by a.
Since a is $$3$$, $$3f{\left(x+2\right)}$$ means that the graph is stretched vertically by $$3$$.
For some value a, $$f{\left(x\right)}+a$$ means that f(x) is translated up by a units. Similarly, $$f(x)-a$$ means that f(x) is translated down by a units.
Since a is $$-5$$, $$3f{\left(x+2\right)}-5$$ means that the graph is translated down by $$5$$.

So our final answer is $$x=8$$ and $$x=-2$$.

What is the decay parameter $$m$$?
The decay parameter is computed by 1/(average random variable value). In our case, the average is $$8$$.
Plug in the obtained decay parameter into the distiribution formula given earlier into $$m$$ to get the representative exponential distribution.\n##figure1.gif##
$$m$$ is denoted as the decay parameter where $$1$$ is divided by the random variable average.
μ is the population average.
We need to find $$P\left(X>25\right)$$ with given information $$m=\frac{1}{20}$$
Since $$P\left(X<x\right)$$ $$=$$ $$1-e^{\left(-m x\right)}$$, then we can use $$P\left(X>x\right)=1-1-e^{\left(-m x\right)}$$ $$=$$ $$e^{\left(-m x\right)}$$. Remember that $$m$$ is our decay parameter respective to the problem that we are facing.
$$P\left(X>25\right)=e^{25\left(-\frac{1}{20}\right)}$$
To do any calculations, you must know $$m$$, the decay parameter. $$m=\frac{1}{mean}$$. It is given that the mean amount of years that the certain computer lasts is ten years.

$$P\left(X>7\right)=e^{7\left(-0.1\right)}$$
On the average, one computer part lasts ten years. Make use of this known average to compute how on average you would last with $$5$$ computers.
Five computer parts, if they are used one right after the other would last, on the average, five computers times ten years.
First, find out how to get the probability that a computer lasts $$9$$ years and $$11$$ years separately. We know that $$m=0.1$$, and using the formula to find the probability at certain years, the probability of $$x$$ years is equal to $$e^{-0.1 x}$$.
We can alternatively use a PDF function to get the $$P\left(X>9\right)$$ and $$P\left(X>11\right)$$. Afterwards, we can subtract the probabilities from each other and set the value to positive since probability is always positive.
$$P\left(9<X<11\right)=|P\left(X<9\right)-P\left(X<11\right)|$$
Five cars pass by per minute, we want to find the seconds passed between each car on average
There are five cars that pass in a minute, so to find the seconds per car passed, we divide the minute in seconds into five: $$60$$ seconds divided by $$5$$ cars
We know that it takes $$12$$ seconds on average for each car to pass by, if there were seven cars that passed by, how many seconds on average has elapsed between the first and seventh car?
Multiply the average seconds that a car passes by by the number off pass by successions
We want to find the probability when a car passes by within a $$20$$ second interval. Therefore, any car may pass by within these $$20$$ seconds. Find $$P\left(X<20\right)$$, where X is the time in seconds between successive cars.
Find the probability in respect to a distribution modeled after seconds. Decay parameter $$m=$$?
$$m$$ is denoted as the decay parameter where $$1$$ is divided by the random variable average.
Note that the decay parameter must be in seconds. We know that it takes $$5$$ cars in a minute to pass by on average, and earlier calculated that there are on average12 seconds between each car. Use the $$12$$ seconds as the average.
$$P\left(X<x\right)$$ $$=$$ $$1-e^{\left(-m x\right)}$$, where $$x$$ is the desired conditional random variable cut off. We are finding $$P\left(X<20\right)$$ because within the $$20$$ second interval, there may be a car.
This is an exponential distribution with a given average. Use $$y=m e^{\left(-m\right) x}$$
In $$y=m e^{\left(-m\right) x}$$, $$m$$, the decay parameter is equal to $$\frac{1}{mean}$$.

We want to find find $$P\left(4<x<5\right)$$. Use the CDF function on a calculator to find the area between $$x=4$$ and $$x=5$$\n##figure1.gif##

A simple calculation of can also be done: The probability that a postal clerk spends four to five minutes with a randomly selected customer is P(4 < X < 5) $$=$$ P(<P(X < 4) $$=$$ $$0.7135$$ - $$0.6321$$
Find the minutes cutoff when the probability of both sides of the exponential distribution is equal to $$0.5$$. The diagram shown has the value k, the 50th percentile.\n##figure2.gif##
You may use $$P\left(X<k\right)$$ and $$P\left(X<k\right)=1-e^{-0.25 k}$$ to find k.
What is the value of $$P\left(X<k\right)$$ in this case?
Great, we can now set up the equation $$0.5=1-e^{-0.25 k}$$ and solve for k.
Remember that ln(e) can be used to cancel out natural e's
We are given the average minutes that customers took, $$4$$ minutes. Compare it to the 50th percentile minutes.
Mean $$=$$ $$4$$ minutes, 50th percentile or median $$=$$ $$2.8$$ minutes
Using the decay parameter $$\frac{1}{12}$$, we know that the average elapsed time of a ohone call in munutes is $$12$$ minutes on an exponential distribution.
We may use a PDF function and set the decay parameter to $$\frac{1}{12}$$ and use $$P\left(X>x\right)$$, where $$x$$ is the probability cutoff.
Set $$x$$ to $$5$$ minutes since we want to find the area under the exponential distribution curve when X is greater than $$5$$.
On average four calls occur per minutes. Sixty seconds divided by four callers would yield $$15$$ seconds per caller on average.
$$m$$ must be in minutes, we can convert to minutes by dividing $$15$$ seconds by $$60$$.
Let T equal the time elapsed between calls. From part a, the mean is found to be $$0.25$$, so the decay parameter is $$1$$ divided by the mean, $$0.25$$.
The cumulative distribution function is $$P\left(T<t\right)$$ $$=$$ $$1-e^{\left(-4t\right)}$$.
We want to find the area under the exponential distiributiion function where T is less than the $$t=\frac{1}{6}$$ minutes boundary.
The probability that the next call occurs in less than $$10$$ seconds (where $$10$$ seconds is equal to $$\frac{1}{6}$$ minutes) is $$P\left(T<\frac{1}{6}\right)=1-e^{\left(-4t\right)}$$, where $$t$$ is $$\frac{1}{6}$$.\n##figure1.gif##

We are interested in the years it takes AFTER reaching the age $$60$$ for someone to retire.
Since we are interested in the amount of years it takes for an individual to retire after the age of $$60$$, we are specifically organizing data to be separated by years.
We are given that the data collected can be exponentially distributed with an average of about five years after reaching the age $$60$$.
We can set our decay parameter and use a PDF function to find $$P\left(X>x\right)$$ where X is greater than a bounded value.

Since we are looking at a population aged $$80$$ years old or older, we can subtract $$60$$ from $$80$$ to get $$20$$ as our chosen bound value $$x$$ when solving $$P\left(X>x\right)$$.
We know that the average pair of running shoes last $$18$$ months on an exponential distribution.
The decay parameter is computed by 1/(average random variable value). In our case, the average is $$18$$.
Using a PDF function, we can set the appropiate decay parameter and set $$P\left(X>x\right)$$, where $$x$$ is the cutoff boundary for the probability.
We can set $$x$$ equal to $$15$$ to represent the $$15$$ months and the $$P\left(X>x\right)$$ PDF will yield the area under the curves past $$X>15$$.
On average, how long would six pairs of running shoes last if they are used one after the other? Eighty percent of running shoes last at most how long if used every day?
We know that the average amount of time that a running shoe lasts if used everyday lasts $$18$$ months. We can use that value to predict the average amount of time needed to use up six shoes.
We can multiply $$18$$ months and $$6$$ shoes to get the average amount of time to use up $$6$$ running shoes back to back everyday
You may use a calculator exponential PDF function where $$m$$ can be set to the decay parameter given by $$\frac{1}{18}$$, and finding the $$P\left(X>15\right)$$.
Decay parameter $$m=$$?
The given average is $$18$$ days, divide $$1$$ by $$18$$ to get the decay parameter
On the average, one pair of running shoes lasts $$18$$ months if they are used every day. Multiply that average by the number of pairs that you want to calculate how long will last. Remember, a pair is two individual shoes.
Since we expect $$30$$ customers to arrive per hour (60 minutes), we expect on average one customer to arrive every two minutes on average.
We know that a customer arrives every two minutes. We can use that to estimate how many minutes it will take for three customers to arrive.
Since one customer arrives every two minutes on average, it will take six minutes on average for three customers to arrive.
By part a, we know that the average is $$2$$ minutes between each customer. $$\frac{1}{mean}=decay$$ parameter. The mean is $$2$$ minutes.
$$P\left(X<x\right)$$ $$=$$ $$1-e^{\left(-m x\right)}$$.
The cumulative distribution function is $$P\left(X<x\right)=1-e^{-0.5 x}$$, we are finding the area under the curve where X is less than $$1$$.
The expression to compute the probability is $$P\left(X<1\right)=1-e^{1-0.5}$$.\n##figure1.gif##
To do any calculations, you must know $$m$$, the decay parameter. $$m=\frac{1}{mean}$$. It is given that the mean amount of days that travelers purchase their airline tickets is equal to $$15$$ days.
What is the value of $$m$$?
The probability desnsity function is $$f(x)=m e^{\left(-m x\right)}$$, where e is the natural number $$e=2.7182818..$$.
To find the certain probability in an exponential distribution, set the random vairable $$x$$ to the desired probability condition: For example $$f(5)=m e^{\left(-5m\right)}$$ will yield the probability that a random trial yields $$x=5$$.
We are trying to find the probability that travelers purchase their tickets fewer than $$10$$ days in advance, we must find $$P\left(x<10\right)$$, so we may do $$1-P(x=1)-P(x=2)-...-P(x=10)$$, using $$f(x)=m e^{\left(-m x\right)}$$, but to do it faster, we may use the CDF function to find the total area of the values that $$x<10$$.
Using CDF of X < $$10$$ and rounding to the nearest $$3$$ decimals, we get $$0.067$$
We want to find the corresponding $$x$$ days value that 50% of travelers wait. One way of doing so would be using a PDF function on a calculator and inputting $$0.5$$ probability to yield the X value cutoff value for half of the exponential distribution curve.

Use the associative and commutative property of multiplication to group like terms together
In this expression, what is the like term of $$a^4$$?
$$18$$ and $$-27$$ are consider as like terms because they are both real numbers. $$a^4$$ and $$a^9$$ are consider like terms because they are different power of a. Similar for $$b^8$$ and $$b^5$$
We can rewrite the given expression in a new way by grouping the like terms using parenthese, $$\frac{18a^4 b^8}{\left(-27a^9 b^5\right)}=\frac{18}{-27} \frac{a^4}{a^9} \frac{b^8}{b^5}$$
Simplify $$\frac{18}{-27}$$

Simplify $$\frac{45}{-60}$$
Simplify $$\frac{x^5}{x^8}$$
Simplify $$\frac{y^9}{y^6}$$

Divide the leading term in the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. $$\frac{x^2}{x}=x$$
Multiply the result by the divisor. $$x \left(x+8\right)=x^2+8x$$
Subtract the divident from the result. $$x^2+11x+16-x^2+8x=3x+16$$
Divide the leading term of the remainder. $$\frac{3x}{x}=3$$
Multiply the result by the divisor. $$3\left(x+8\right)=3x+24$$

There are a few ways to approach this problem. We need to divide the expression for the volume of the solid by the expressions for the length and width. Let us create a sketch.\n##figure1.gif##
We can now write an equation by substituting the known values into the formula for the volume of a rectangular solid. $$V=l w h$$. $$3x^4-3x^3-33x^2+54x=3x \left(x-2\right) h$$\n
To solve for $$h$$, we can first divide both sides by $$3x$$. We now have $$(x-2)h=x^3-x^2-11x+18$$
We now solve for $$h$$ by using synthetic division as shown.\n##figure2.gif##

We don’t know if the pre-1981 data was collected from a single year.
So we don’t have an accurate $$x$$ value for this figure.Regression equation: ŷ (#Flu Cases) $$=$$ -3,448,225 + $$1749.777$$ (year)
Use the given equation and substitute $$x$$ $$=$$ $$1985$$
Use the given equation and substitute $$x$$ $$=$$ $$1990$$
The range of $$x$$ values was $$1981$$ to 2002; the year $$1970$$ is not in this range.
The regression equation does not apply, because predicting for the year $$1970$$ is extrapolation, which requires a different process. Also, a negative number does not make sense in this context, where we are predicting flu cases diagnosed.

Then, we convert $$183$$ minutes into hours.
The relation between minutes and hours is $$60$$ $$min=1$$ hr.
What is $$183$$ minutes in hours?
To convert $$183$$ minutes into hours, we use the expression $$183$$ $$min=(183$$ min)*(1 hr)/(60 min)=(183)*(1 hr)/(60)=3.05 hr. The first equality holds because $$1$$ $$hr=60$$ min, and the second equation holds because we can cancel the min.

The next step is to convert $$144$$ inches into yards. But since we don't know the conversion between inches and yards right away, we will need to convert inches into feet first, and then convert feet into yards.
The relation between inches and feet is $$12$$ $$inches=1$$ foot.
What is $$144$$ inches in feet?
To convert $$144$$ inches into feet, we use the expression $$144$$ $$inches=(144$$ inches)*(1 foot)/(12 inches)=(144)*(1 foot)/(12)=12 feet. The first equality holds because $$1$$ $$foot=12$$ inches, and the second equation holds because we can cancel the inches.
The relation between feet and yards is $$3$$ $$feet=1$$ yard.
What is $$12$$ feet in yards?
To convert $$12$$ feet into yards, we use the expression $$12$$ $$feet=(12$$ feet)*(1 yard)/(3 feet)=(12)*(1 yard)/(3)=4 yards. The first equality holds because $$1$$ $$yard=3$$ feet, and the second equation holds because we can cancel the feet.
The first step is to multiply the measurement to be converted by 1; write $$1$$ as a fraction relating the units given and the units needed.
The conversion from meters to kilometers is 1,000 $$m=1$$ km.
Using the relation between km and $$m$$, we can rewrite the $$1$$ we multiply in the first step as (1 km)/(1000 m), so we get the expression (3072 m)*(1 km)/(1000 m).
$$m$$ divides out, so we get the expression (3072)*(1 km)/1000.
Dividing the expression, we get the final answer $$3.072$$ km.

The relation between meters and centimeters is $$1$$ $$m=100$$ cm.
We start by converting Matthias' height into centimeters. What is $$1.8$$ $$m$$ in cm?
To convert $$1.8$$ $$m$$ into cm, we use the expression $$1.8$$ $$m=(1.8$$ m)*(100 cm)/(1 m)=(1.8)*(100 cm)/(1)=180 cm. The first equality holds because $$100$$ $$cm=1$$ $$m$$, and the second equation holds because we can cancel the $$m$$.
Now that we have both Matthias and his son's heights in centimeters, to find the difference between their heights in centimeters, we can simply subtract the the two numbers.
What is $$180-89$$?
Since the problem wants the answer in grams, we will convert all measurements into grams before proceeding with arithmetics.
The relation between grams and kilograms is $$1000$$ $$g=1$$ kg.

kg divides out, so we get the expression (20)*(2.2 lb)/(1).
Multiplying the expression, we get the final answer $$44$$ lb.
We don't know the conversion between gallons and liters right away, but we do know the conversion from gallons to quart and the conversion from quart to liters.Therefore, we can convert the measurement into quarts first, then convert it into liters.
The conversion from gallons to quarts is $$1$$ $$gal=4$$ qt.
The first step is to multiply the measurement to be converted by 1; write $$1$$ as a fraction relating the units given and the units needed.
Using the relation between gal and qt., we can rewrite the $$1$$ we multiply in the last step as (4 qt.)/(1 gal), so we get the expression (14 gal)*(4 qt.)/(1 gal).
gal divides out, so we get the expression (14)*(4 qt.)/(1).
Multiplying the expression, we get $$14$$ $$gal=56$$ qt.
Our next step is to convert $$56$$ qt. into liters.
The conversion from quarts to liters is $$1$$ $$qt.=0.95$$ L.
The first step is to multiply the measurement to be converted by 1; write $$1$$ as a fraction relating the units given and the units needed.
Using the relation between qt. and L, we can rewrite the $$1$$ we multiply in the last step as $$(0.95$$ L)/(1 qt.), so we get the expression (56 qt.)*(0.95 L)/(1 qt.).
qt. divides out, so we get the expression (56)*(0.95 L)/(1).

If a point is a solution to a system, then it satisfies both equations.
Let us plug in the point. $$2(3)-6(1)=0$$, $$0=0$$. The first equation is satisfied. $$3(3)-4(1)=5$$, $$5=5$$. The second equation is satisfied. The point is a solution.
We can multiply the second equation by $$5$$ and then add to get $$16x=64$$
$$16x=64$$ can be simplified to $$x=4$$.
Plugging $$x=4$$ into the first equation, we get that $$2\left(4\right)+y=13$$, which means that $$y=5$$
We can multiply the second equation by $$-5$$ and then add to get $$-13x=-78$$
$$-13x=-78$$ simplifies to $$x=6$$.
Plugging $$x=4$$ into the second equation, we get that $$3(6)-y=17$$, which means that $$y=1$$.
We can multiply the second equation by $$-3$$ and then add to get $$-x=-7$$.
$$-x=-7$$ simplifies to $$x=7$$
Plugging $$x=7$$ into the second equation, we get that $$2(7)-y=2$$, which means that $$y=12$$
We can multiply the second equation by $$5$$ and the first equation by $$2$$ and add to get $$31x=62$$
$$31x=62$$ simplifies to $$x=2$$.

We can multiply the second equation by $$-2$$ and add to get $$-13y=65$$.
$$-13y=65$$ simplifies to $$y=-5$$.
Plugging $$y=-5$$ into the second equation, we get that 2x+5(-5)=-31, which means that $$x=-3$$.

We can multiply the second equation by $$2$$ and then add the two to get $$-x=2$$.
$$-x=2$$ can be simplified to $$x=-2$$.
Plugging $$x=-2$$ into the first equation, we get that 5(-2)+2y=2, which means that $$2y=12$$, $$y=6$$.

First, you need to identify the two curves that define the region whose area you want to find. In this case, f(x) is the upper curve and g(x) is the lower curve
$$A=\int (f(x)-g(x) \,dx$$
With $$f(x)=x+4$$ and $$g(x)=3-\frac{x}{2}$$ over the given integral [1,4], we can complete the integral expression as $$A=\int_{1}^{4} x+4-3-\frac{x}{2} \,dx=\int_{1}^{4} \frac{3x}{2}+1 \,dx$$
$$\int_{1}^{4} \frac{3x}{2}+1 \,dx=\frac{3x^2}{4}+x$$ as the limits go from $$x=1$$ to $$x=4$$
$$16-\frac{7}{4}=\frac{57}{4}$$
In order to set up the definite integrals of the $$2$$ functions, we have to find the limits where they intersect by setting them equal to each other and solve for $$y$$.
$$x^2=-\left(x^2\right)+18x$$ then $$x=0$$ and $$x=9$$.
What is the upper graph in this problem?
The area of A is given by $$\int_{a}^{b} |f{\left(x\right)}-g{\left(x\right)}| \,dx$$, as f(x) is an upper graph and g(x) is the lower one.
$$\int_{0}^{9} -\left(x^2\right)+18x-x^2 \,dx$$
$$-\left(\frac{2x^2}{3}\right)+\frac{18x^2}{2}$$ as the limits go from $$x=0$$ to $$x=9$$.
$$-\left(\frac{2\times9^3}{3}\right)+9\times9^2=243$$
In this problem, the area of the region between $$2$$ curves can be broken into $$2$$ sub-regions as [-1,0] and [0,1].
What is the area of the interval from $$-1$$ to 0?
/int{x**2-(2*x)-x**3,-1,0,x}=0-(((-1)**3)/3)-(-1)**2-(-1)**4)/4)=19/12
What is the area of the interval from $$0$$ to 1?
$$\int_{0}^{1} x^3-x^2+2x \,dx=\frac{1^4}{4}-\frac{1^3}{3}+1^2=\frac{11}{12}$$
$$\frac{19}{12}+\frac{11}{12}=\frac{5}{2}$$
You'll need to find the x-values where the two curves intersect by setting the given $$2$$ functions equal to each other $$f(x)=g(x)$$
What are the limits of integration?
As $$f(x)=g(x)$$, we then have $$9-{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}^2=6-x$$
$$9-\frac{x}{4}=6-x$$ then $$\left(x-6\right) \left(x+2\right)=0$$. The graphs of functions intersect when $$x=6$$ and $$x=-2$$ so we want to integrate from $$-2$$ to $$6$$.
$$\int_{-2}^{6} 9-{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}^2-6-x \,dx=\int_{-2}^{6} 3-\frac{x^2}{4}+x \,dx$$
$$3x-\frac{x^3}{12}+\frac{x^2}{2}$$ as the limits go from $$x=-2$$ to $$x=6$$
The area of the region is $$\frac{64}{3}$$ $${unit}^2$$
$$A=\int_{a}^{b} |f(x)-g(x)| \,dx=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} cosx-sinx \,dx+\int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{pi} sinx-cosx \,dx$$
$$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} cosx-sinx \,dx=sinx+cox$$ with $$x$$ goes from $$0$$ to $$\frac{\pi}{4}$$.
What is the Area of a region bounded from $$x=0$$ to $$x=\frac{\pi}{4}$$?
$$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} -cosx-sinx \,dx=sinx+cox$$ with $$x$$ goes from $$\frac{\pi}{4}$$ to pi
What is the Area of a region bounded from $$x=0$$ to $$x=\frac{\pi}{4}$$?
$$\sqrt{2}-1+\sqrt{2}+1=2\sqrt{2}$$ $${units}^2$$
Set $$f(x)=g(x)$$ and solve for $$x$$. After solving for $$x$$, we obtain $$x=1$$ where the graphs intersect.
Since the Area from $$0$$ to $$1$$ and the Area from $$1$$ to $$2$$ are not the same, we have to integrate each of them seperately.
What is the area of the interval from $$0$$ to 1?
What is the area of the interval from $$1$$ to 2?
Adding these areas together, we obtain $$A=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{5}{6}$$
We must first express the graphs as functions of $$y$$. The curve on the left can be represented by the function $$x=\sqrt{y}$$. The curve on the right can be represented by the funcgion $$x=2-y$$.\n##figure1.gif##
Now we have to determine the limits of integration. The region is bounded below by the x-axis, so the lower limit of integration is $$y=0$$.
The region is bounded below by the x-axis, so the lower limit of integration is $$y=0$$. The upper limit of integration is determined by the point where the two graphs intersect, which is the point $$(1,1)$$ so the upper limit of integration is $$y=1$$.
The area of the region $$A=\int_{0}^{1} 2-y-\sqrt{y} \,dy$$
$$2y-\frac{y^2}{2}-\frac{\frac{2}{3} y^3}{2}$$ with the limits go from $$y=0$$ to $$y=1$$.
$$2\times1-\frac{1^2}{2}-\frac{\frac{2}{3} 1^3}{2}-2\times0-\frac{0^2}{2}-\frac{\frac{2}{3} 0^3}{2}=\frac{5}{6}$$
In order to set up the definite integrals of the $$2$$ functions, we have to find the limits where they intersect by setting them equal to each other and solve for $$x$$.
$$x^2-3=1$$ then $$x=2$$ and $$x=-2$$. So we obtain $$x=-2$$ as a lower limit and $$x=2$$ as an upper limit.
The area of A is given by $$int{|f(x)-g(x)|, a, b, x$$,} as f(x) is an upper graph and g(x) is the lower one.
What is the upper graph in this problem?
$$\int_{-2}^{2} 1-x^2+3 \,dx$$
$$4x-\frac{x^3}{3}$$ as the limtis go from $$x=-2$$ to $$x=2$$
$$4\times2-\frac{2^3}{3}-4\left(-2\right)-\frac{{\left(-2\right)}^3}{3}=\frac{32}{3}$$
In order to set up the definite integrals of the $$2$$ functions, we have to find the limits where they intersect by setting them equal to each other and solve for $$x$$.
$$x^3=x^2+x$$ then $$x=0$$, $$x=\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$$ and $$x=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$$. So we obtain $$x=\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$$ as a lower limit and $$x=0$$ as an upper limit for the region on the left side of the y-axis. The second limit for the region on the right side of the y-axis has a lower limit as $$x=0$$ and an upper limit as $$x=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$$
The area of A is given by int{abs(f(x)-g(x)),a,b,x}, as f(x) is an upper graph and g(x) is the lower one.
What is the upper graph for the region on the left side of y-axis?
What is the upper graph for the region on the right side of y-axis?
$$\int_{\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}}^{0} x^3-x^2-x \,dx+\int_{0}^{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}} x^2+x-x^3 \,dx$$
$$\frac{13-5\sqrt{5}}{24}+\frac{13+5\sqrt{5}}{24}=\frac{13}{12}$$
In order to set up the definite integrals of the $$2$$ functions, we have to find the limits where they intersect by setting them equal to each other and solve for $$y$$.
$$y^2=9$$ then $$y=-3$$ and $$y=3$$.
The area of A is given by $$\int_{c}^{d} |u\left(y\right)-v\left(y\right)| \,dy$$, as u(y) is an upper graph and v(y)is the lower one.
What is the right graph in this problem?
$$\int_{-3}^{3} 9-y^2 \,dy$$
$$9y-\frac{y^3}{3}$$ as the limits go from $$y=-3$$ to $$y=3$$
$$9\times3-\frac{3^3}{3}-9\left(-3\right)-\frac{{\left(-3\right)}^3}{3}=36$$
In order to set up the definite integrals of the $$2$$ functions, we have to find the limits where they intersect by setting them equal to each other and solve for $$y$$.
$$y^2=y$$ then $$y=0$$ and $$y=1$$.
The area of A is given by $$\int_{c}^{d} |u\left(y\right)-v\left(y\right)| \,dy$$, as u(y) is an upper graph and v(y)is the lower one.
What is the right graph in this problem?
$$\int_{0}^{1} y-y^2 \,dy$$
$$\frac{y^2}{2}-\frac{y^3}{3}$$ as the limits go from $$y=0$$ to $$y=1$$
(1**2)/2)-(1**3)/3=1/6

Since $${\left(x^2\right)}^2=x^4$$, we can let $$u=x^2$$. Substitute $$x^2$$ for u throughout the equation.
Now, factor the equation so that it is in the form (au~b)(cu~d).
Solve for the variable u by setting each of the two terms equal to zero. Then, once you have found a value for u, plug in $$x^2$$ for u.
Solve for $$x$$ by taking the square root of both sides.
Check all $$4$$ $$x$$ values(including both positive and negative values) you just solved for by plugging them back into the original equation. If the value is correct, the equation will be equal on both sides after solving.
You can use a placeholder variable to simplify this problem. Set $$u=x+2$$.

We can rewrite the expression as $$x^2+x+10x+10$$ or $$x^2+x+10x+10$$. Let's factor $$x^2+x$$. $$x$$ goes into both expressions, so let's rewrite this as $$x \left(x+1\right)$$. Now, factor $$10x+10$$. $$10$$ goes into both terms, so it is rewritten as $$10\left(x+1\right)$$. Because both $$x \left(x+1\right)$$ and $$10\left(x+1\right)$$ are multiplied by $$x+1$$, we can use the distributive property to rewrite the expression as $$\left(x+1\right) \left(x+10\right)$$.
Now, we can bring back the $$x$$, making our equation $$x \left(x+1\right) \left(x+10\right)$$. Using the Zero Product Property, we can set all the terms equal to zero and solve for $$x$$.
What what value of $$x$$ makes $$x=0$$?
What what value of $$x$$ makes $$x+1=0$$?
Subtract both sides of the equation by $$1$$ to get $$x=-1$$.
What what value of $$x$$ makes $$x+10=0$$?
Subtract $$10$$ from both sides of the equation to get $$x=-10$$.
So, our factors are $$x=0$$, $$-1$$, $$-10$$.
Take the +/- square root of both sides: $$x=\pm \sqrt{8}$$
What is $$\pm \sqrt{8}$$?
$$\sqrt{4}=2$$, and $$\frac{8}{4}=2$$, so $$\sqrt{8}=2\sqrt{2}$$. Remember to take the +/- values.
To isolate the variable, first subtract both sides by one to get $$4x^2=6$$
Next, divide both sides by 4: $$x^2=\frac{6}{4}$$.
Take the +/- square root of both sides: $$x=\pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{4}}$$.
What is $$\pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{4}}$$?
$$\sqrt{6}$$ is in its simplest form, so we can leave it as it is. $$\sqrt{4}=2$$, so the final answer is $$\frac{\pm \sqrt{6}}{2}$$
To isolate the variable, first divide both sides by $$3$$ to get $${\left(x-4\right)}^2=5$$.
Take the +/- square root of both sides: $$x-4=\pm \sqrt{5}$$.
Add $$4$$ to both sides of the equation: $$x=\pm \sqrt{5}+4$$. This is our final answer.
First, we need to move the constant term to the other side by adding both sides by 5: $$x^2-3x=5$$.
Now, we can take our $$b$$ term and find the value we need to complete the square. $$\frac{\left(-3\right)}{2}=\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)$$. Then, $${\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)}^2=\frac{9}{4}$$.
Here, we can add $$\frac{9}{4}$$ to both sides of the equation: $$x^2-3x+\frac{9}{4}=5+\frac{9}{4}$$.
Finally, we can simplify and factor: $${\left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right)}^2=\frac{29}{4}$$.
We now take the square root of both sides: $$x-\frac{3}{2}=\left(+plusminus\right)+\frac{\sqrt{29}}{2}$$.
The last step is to add $$\frac{3}{2}$$ to both sides, so the answers are $$\frac{3+\sqrt{29}}{2}$$ and $$\frac{3-\sqrt{29}}{2}$$.
We need to take our $$b$$ term and find the value we need to complete the square. $$\frac{\left(-6\right)}{2}=\left(-\frac{6}{2}\right)$$. Then, $${\left(-\frac{6}{2}\right)}^2=\frac{36}{4}$$, or $$9$$.
Here, we can add $$9$$ to both sides of the equation: $$x^2-6x+9=13+9$$.
Finally, we can simplify and factor: $${\left(x-3\right)}^2=22$$.
We now take the square root of both sides: $$(x-(3))=\left(+plusminus\right)+\sqrt{22}$$.
The last step is to add $$3$$ to both sides, so the answers are $$3+\sqrt{22}$$ and $$3-\sqrt{22}$$.
First, we need to identify our variables: $$a=1$$, $$b=5$$, and $$c=1$$
Now we can plug our variables into the Quadratic Formula: $$\frac{\left(-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\right)}{2} a$$ becomes $$\frac{\left(-5\pm \sqrt{5^2-4\times1\times1}\right)}{2\times1}$$.
This simplies to our final answers: $$\frac{\left(-5+\sqrt{21}\right)}{2}$$ and $$\frac{\left(-5-\sqrt{21}\right)}{2}$$.
The first step is to identify the coefficient of each term.
What is the coefficient of $$x^2$$?
What is the coefficient of $$x$$?
What is the coefficient of 2?
Next, subsitute the coefficients of each term into the quadratic formula.
The quadratic formula is $$x=\frac{\left(-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\right)}{2a}$$.

The diagram gives the measurements of the hypotenuse and one of the legs.
The Pythagorean Theorem is given as $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$, where a and $$b$$ refer to the legs of a right triangle adjacent to the $$90$$ degree angle, and c refers to the hypotenuse.
To complete the square, we need to add a term to make the entire expression of the form $$a^2+2ab+b^2$$.
In this case, we want to add a term to $$2x^2-3x$$ to make it a perfect square. Assume $$2x^2$$ is the $$a^2$$ term and $$-3x$$ is the 2ab term.
What term should we add to both sides of the equation to make this true?
Now that we added $$\frac{9}{8}$$ to both sides, we get that $${\left(\sqrt{2} x-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4}\right)}^2=1+\frac{9}{8}$$

When $$x=-p$$ and -q, $$\left(x+p\right) \left(x+q\right)=0$$.

Since all of the terms inclue $$-x$$, we can factor it out of the equation: $$-x \left(3x^2+5x+2\right)=0$$.
Now we can factor by grouping. $$2\times3=6$$, so we should look for two numbers that multiply to $$6$$ and add to $$5$$. $$2$$ and $$3$$ satisfy this.
What is the factored expression?
We can rewrite the expression as $$3x^2+3x+2x+2$$ or $$3x^2+3x+2x+2$$. Let's factor $$3x^2+3x$$. $$3x$$ goes into both expressions, so let's rewrite this as $$3x \left(x+1\right)$$. Now, factor $$2x+2$$. $$2$$ goes into both terms, so it is rewritten as $$2\left(x+1\right)$$. Because both $$3x \left(x+1\right)$$ and $$2\left(x+1\right)$$ are multiplied by $$x+1$$, we can use the distributive property to rewrite the expression as $$\left(x+1\right) \left(3x+2\right)$$.
Now, we can bring back the $$-x$$, making our equation $$-x \left(x+1\right) \left(3x+2\right)$$. Using the Zero Product Property, we can set all the terms equal to zero and solve for $$x$$.
What what value of $$x$$ makes $$-x=0$$?
What what value of $$x$$ makes $$x+1=0$$?
Subtract $$1$$ from both sides of the equation to get $$x=-1$$.
What what value of $$x$$ makes $$3x+2=0$$?
Subtract $$2$$ from both sides of the equation, then divide by three to get $$x=\frac{-2}{3}$$.
So, our factors are $$x=0$$, $$\frac{-2}{3}$$, $$-1$$.

Write the inequality as one quotient on the left and zero on the right.
Determine the critical points—the points where the rational expression will be zero or undefined.
When is the equation undefine? Note that the equation is undefined when the denominator equal to zero.
Solve the equation $$x+4=0$$. What is the value of $$x$$?
When does the equation equal zero? Note that the equation is undefined when the numerator equal to zero.
Solve the equation $$x-3=0$$. What is the value of $$x$$?
Given that the $$x=3$$ and $$x=-4$$ are the two critical points, we can divide the number line into three intervals, namely, $$(-\infty,-4)$$, $$(-4,3)$$ and $$(3,\infty)$$.
To find the sign of each factor in an interval, we choose any point in that interval and use it as a test point. Any point in the interval will give the expression the same sign, so we can choose any point in the interval.
For the interval $$(-\infty,-4)$$, take the point $$x=-5$$ within the interval and plug it into the original expression. What is the value of $$\frac{x-3}{x+4}$$ after plugging in the value $$x=-5$$?
Since $$8$$ is a positive numer greater than $$0$$, we get the sign of quotient is positive in the interval $$(-\infty,-4)$$.
For the interval $$(-4,3)$$, take the point $$x=0$$ within the interval and plug it into the original expression $$\frac{x-3}{x+4}$$. We get $$\frac{-3}{4}$$ after plugging in $$x=0$$ into the quotient $$\frac{x-3}{x+4}$$. $$\frac{-3}{4}$$ is a negative number, so we can mark the quotient negative in the interval $$(-4,3)$$.
For the interval $$(3,\infty)$$, take the point $$x=4$$ within the interval and plug it into the original expression $$\frac{x-3}{x+4}$$. We get $$\frac{1}{8}$$ after plugging in $$x=4$$ into the quotient $$\frac{x-3}{x+4}$$. $$\frac{1}{8}$$ is a positive number, so we can mark the quotient positive in the interval $$(3,\infty)$$.
We want the quotient to be greater than or equal to zero, so the numbers in the intervals $$(-\infty,-4)$$ and $$(3,\infty)$$ are solutions.
The critical point $$x=-4$$ makes the denominator $$0$$, so it must be excluded from the solution and we mark it with a parenthesis.\nThe critical point $$x=3$$ makes the whole rational expression $$0$$. The inequality requires that the rational expression be greater than or equal to $$0$$. So, $$3$$ is part of the solution and we will mark it with a bracket.
We know that $$(-\infty,4)$$, $$(3,\infty)$$ and $$x=3$$ are the answer, please use "[ ]". "( )" and U to write it in a mathematical form.
Write the inequality as one quotient on the left and zero on the right.
By subtracting $$2$$ to get zero on the right, we get $$\frac{6x}{x-6}-2>0$$
LCD for $$\frac{6x}{x-6}$$ and $$2$$ is $$(x-6)$$, we can rewrite $$2$$ as $$\frac{2\left(x-6\right)}{x-6}$$. We can rewrite $$\frac{6x}{x-6}-2$$ as $$\frac{6x}{x-6}-\frac{2\left(x-6\right)}{x-6}$$.
By subtracting the numerators and placing the difference over the common denominator, we can rewrite ((6*x)/(x-6))-(2(x-6)/(x-6))) as $$\frac{6x-2\left(x-6\right)}{x-6}$$.
$$\frac{6x-2\left(x-6\right)}{x-6}=\frac{4x+12}{x-6}$$

To find the sign of each factor in an interval, we choose any point in that interval and use it as a test point. Any point in the interval will give the expression the same sign, so we can choose any point in the interval.

Since $$\frac{2}{5}$$ is a positive numer greater than $$0$$, we get the sign of quotient is positive in the interval $$(-\infty,-3)$$.
For the interval $$(-3,6)$$, take the point $$x=0$$ within the interval and plug it into the original expression $$\frac{4x+12}{x-6}$$. We get $$-2$$ after plugging in $$x=0$$ into the quotient $$\frac{4x+12}{x-6}$$. $$-2$$ is a negative number, so we can mark the quotient negative in the interval $$(-3,6)$$.
For the interval $$(6,\infty)$$, take the point $$x=7$$ within the interval and plug it into the original expression $$\frac{4x+12}{x-6}$$. We get $$40$$ after plugging in $$x=7$$ into the quotient $$\frac{4x+12}{x-6}$$. $$40$$ is a positive number, so we can mark the quotient positive in the interval $$(6,\infty)$$.
We want the quotient to be greater than zero, so the numbers in the interval $$(-\infty,-3)$$ or $$(6,\infty)$$ are the solution.

We can first identify what direction the parabola is facing to determine whether we will be solving for a maximum or minimum. Since the coefficient with the greatest variable power is positive, the parabola will be oriented as a "U" meaning we will be solving for a minimum.
Solving for the minimum value is the same as finding the vertex of the parabola. To find the x-coordinate of the vertex we can use the equation $$x=\frac{-b}{2a}$$. What is the x-coordinate of the vertex?
Given the x-coordinate, we can plug it in to solve for the y-coordinate of the vertex. What is the y-coordinate?

Notice that the traveler is disputing about the consistency of the average flight times, not the literal average.
Since the consistency of flight times is discussed, the variance is being disputed.
A sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Let s denote standard deviation. If s would be the standard deviation, what would be thte variance?
$$s^2$$ is the variance, therefore the variance can be found by squaring the standard deviation, or the square of $$15$$.
The traveler is disputing the claim that the variance is $$150$$. The traveler collected their own data to test against the claim, therefore the traveler's claim is the alternative claim.
We have to be specific about the hypothesis when constructing tests so that we can get proper conclusions. Sometimes it can be hard to pin point the key alternative hypothesis like in this case because the traveler only "doubts" the claim which would lead us to believe that the alternative hypothesis would be that the variance isn't equal to $$150$$. However, the "no more than 150" claim by the airline is the most clear message that the null hypothesis is that the variance is less than or equal to $$150$$, therefore we should model our hypotheses off of airline's null claim.
When the alternative claim is that the test statistic is greater than the null value, then the test is a right tailed test.


Recall that the test statistic in a test of a single variance is test statistic $$X^2=\frac{\left(n-1\right) s^2}{q^2}$$. Note that $$q^2$$ here denotes the population variance whereas s denotes sample variance.
With n=25,q**2=150,s=15, $$X^2=\frac{\left(25-1\right) {15}^2}{150}$$.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
Since the standard deviation is involved, this is a test of a single variance.
The observer's claim is that the standard deviation is less than six hits, which will be the alternate claim.
What the archer recorded in this case is assumed to be true as the observer is conducting the test to prove the archer wrong.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow $$H_0$$: q**2=6**2,H_a:q**2<6**2
Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.
The word 'less' in the claim that the archer's hits has less variation is the key determining factor to how we choose our test-we will be using a left tailed test.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).
The doctor is testing if the variances are different than what was originally thought, so this is a test of a single variance test.
The analyst's test result is higher than the claimed standard deviation. The analyst's claim is that the standard deviation is more than $$12.2$$ percent, which will be the alternate claim.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow $$H_0$$: q**2=5**2,H_a:q**2>5**2
The test statistic formula is $$X^2=\frac{\left(n-1\right) s^2}{q^2}$$, where $$q^2$$ is population variance.
Let $$X^2$$ denote the test statistic, s denote sample standard deviation, and q denote population standard deviation. $$X^2=\frac{\left(n-1\right) s^2}{q^2}$$
With $$n=15$$, $$s=13.2$$, and $$q=12.2$$, $$X^2$$ is found to be $$16.389$$.
The analyst claims that the standard deviation is greater than what was reported.
The word "greater" in the claim that the broadband speed variation is greater than what was reported is the key determining factor to how we choose our test. Additionally, since the alternative claim has a "greater than" sign, we will be using a right tailed test.
The formula for degrees of freedom denoted by df is $$df=n-1$$.
We found that the test statistic is equal to $$16.389$$, so we can now find $$p-value$$ $$P\left(X^2>16.389\right)=0.2902$$
Since $$p-value$$ $$0.2902>0.05$$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and reject the alternate hypothesis by the analyst that the FCC reported the broadband speed standard deviation lower than the dataset really represents.
Degrees of freedom, often denoted as $$d f$$, are used to find critical cutoff values especially when performing inferential statistics.
Recall that degrees of freedom is k-1, where k is the population size.
What the math instructor in this case believes is assumed to be true as the student is conducting the test to prove the instructor wrong.
The student's claim is that the standard deviation is more than five points, which will be the alternate claim.
Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow $$H_0$$: q**2=5**2,H_a:q**2>5**2
Since the claim is that a single line causes less variation, this is a test of a single variance. The parameter is the population variance $$q^2$$ or the population standard deviation q.

The null claim is that time variations are the same as we are testing if there is greater variation in the waiting times of the single line.

Think of s as the random variable in this test, where the test of a single variance can be right tailed, left tailed, or two tailed.

What is the test type that will be used?
The word "less" in the claim that the claim that a single line causes less variation is the key determining factor to how we choose our test-we will be using a left tailed test.



\n##figure1.gif##
The $$p-value$$ is found to be $$0.000042$$, now compare that to our 5% level of significance to make a conclusion.
Since our significance level $$0.05$$ is less than our $$p-value$$ $$0.000042$$, we reject that the poulation variance is equal to $${7.2}^2$$. We can interpret this as in that we do not think the variation in waiting times is $$7.2$$ minutes and rather think that the variation in waiting times is less.
The statistic being tested is the single standard deviation concerned.
To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).
The observer's claim is that the standard deviation is greater than $$0.81$$, which will be the alternate claim.
The prevailing belief is that the standard deviations are $$0.81$$, and the person conducting the test will test against that null claim.
Even though we are given the population standard deviation the test using populaton variance can still follow $$H_0$$: q**2=0.81**2,H_a:q**2>0.81**2

First we must graph the region R and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.\n##figure1.gif##
The region R under the graph of $$f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$$ over the interval [1,3]. The solid of revolution generated by revolving R about the y-axis.
$$V=\int_{1}^{3} \frac{2\pi x\times1}{x} \,dx=\int_{1}^{3} 2\pi \,dx$$
$$2\pi x$$ with the limits going from $$x=1$$ to $$x=3$$.
$$2\pi\times3-2\pi\times1=4\pi$$
First, graph the region and the solid of revolution as shown.
We set up a rectangle that is parallel to the y-axis and runs over the x-axis.
$$2*pi*\int_{0}^{3} 3x x \,dx=2*pi*\int_{0}^{3} 3x^2 \,dx$$
$$2\pi \frac{3}{3} x^3$$ as the limits going from $$x=0$$ to $$x=3$$.

First we must graph the region R and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.\n##figure1.gif##
The region R between the graph of $$f(x)=x$$ and x-axis over the interval [1,2]. The solid of revolution generated by revolving R about the line $$x=-1$$.
the radius of the shell is given by $$x+1$$
$$V=\int_{1}^{2} 2\pi \left(x+1\right) f{\left(x\right)} \,dx=\int_{1}^{2} 2\pi \left(x+1\right) x \,dx$$
You can put $$2\pi$$ in front of the integral, which makes it $$2*pi*(\int_{1}^{2} \left(x+1\right) x \,dx)=2*pi*(/int{x**2+x$$, 1,2,x})
$$2\pi \left(\frac{x^3}{3}+\frac{x^2}{2}\right)$$ with the limits going from $$x=1$$ to $$x=2$$.
Solve $$2\pi$$ *(2**3/3+2**2/2) $$-\left(2\pi \left(\frac{1^3}{3}+\frac{1^2}{2}\right)\right)$$

Looking at graph, we can find the region is under the line of $$y=3x$$ over the interval [0,3] on x-axis.
$$V=\int_{0}^{3} 2\pi x y \,dx=\int_{0}^{3} 2\pi x\times3 x \,dx=\int_{0}^{3} 6\pi x^2 \,dx$$
So we need to solve $$6\pi$$ times $$\frac{x^3}{3}$$ with the limits going from $$x=0$$ to $$x=3$$
First we must graph the region R, as shown in the following figure.\n##figure1.gif##
when $$x=0$$, $$y=3\times0=0$$, then what is $$y$$ when $$x=3$$?
Looking at graph, we can find the region is under the line of $$y=3x$$ over the interval [0,9] on y-axis.
$$y=3x$$ so $$x=\frac{y}{3}$$. so what is g(y)?
The height is the horizontal distance from $$y=0$$ to $$x=3$$, minus the distance from $$y=0$$ to $$x=\frac{y}{3}$$, which is $$3-\frac{y}{3}$$
$$V=\int_{0}^{9} 2\pi y \left(3-\frac{y}{3}\right) \,dy=\int_{0}^{9} 2\pi \left(3y-\frac{y^2}{3}\right) \,dy$$
So we need to solve $$2\pi$$ times (3*y**2)/2- $$\frac{y^3}{9}$$ with the limits going from $$y=0$$ to $$y=9$$
According to the problem note, the region is under the line of $$y=5x^3$$ over the interval [0,1] on x-axis
Using the shell, $$V=/int{2*pi*x*$$ (5*(x**3)),0,1,x}=2*pi*(/int{5*(x**4),0,1,x})
So we need to solve $$2\pi$$ times $$\frac{5x^5}{5}$$ with limits from $$0$$ to $$1$$.

$$2\pi \left(\frac{2x^3}{3}-\frac{x^4}{4}\right)$$ with the limits going from $$x=0$$ to $$x=2$$.
$$2\pi \left(\frac{2\times2^3}{3}-\frac{2^4}{4}\right)-0=\frac{8\pi}{3}$$

The region Q to the left of the function g(y) over the interval [0,4]. The solid of revolution generated by revolving Q around the x-axis.

$$4\pi \frac{2y^{\frac{5}{2}}}{5}$$ as the limits going from $$x=0$$ to $$x=4$$.
$$4\pi \frac{2\times4^{\frac{5}{2}}}{5}-0=\frac{256\pi}{5}$$
First we must graph the region R and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.\n##figure1.gif##
The region R between the graph of f(x) and the graph of g(x) over the interval [1,4]. The solid of revolution generated by revolving R around the y-axis.
Note that the axis of revolution is the y-axis, so the radius of a shell is given simply by $$x$$. We don’t need to make any adjustments to the $$x-term$$ of our integrand. The height of a shell, though, is given by $$f(x)-g(x)$$, so in this case we need to adjust the f(x) term of the integrand.
$$V=2*pi*\int_{1}^{4} x \left(\sqrt{x}-\frac{1}{x}\right) \,dx=2*pi*\int_{1}^{4} x^{\frac{3}{2}}-1 \,dx$$
$$2\pi \frac{2x^{\frac{5}{2}}}{5}-x$$ with the limits going from $$x=1$$ to $$x=4$$.
2*pi*(((2*4**(5/2))/5)-4-(2*pi*(((2*1**(5/2))/5)-1)=94*pi/5
First, sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown.\n##figure1.gif##
If we want to integrate with respect to $$x$$, we would have to break the integral into two pieces, because we have different functions bounding the region over [0,1] and [1,2]. In this case, using the disk method,
What is the function bounding over [0,1]?
$$V=\int_{0}^{1} \pi x^2 \,dx+\int_{1}^{2} \pi {\left(2-x\right)}^2 \,dx$$
What would the function be if we used the shell method instead?
What would the limits of the function revolving around the y-axis? Express in Interval Expression
The integral of the Shell Method can be set up as $$V=\int_{0}^{1} 2\pi y \left(2-y-y\right) \,dy=\int_{0}^{1} 2\pi y \left(2-2y\right) \,dy$$
First, sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown.\n##figure1.gif##
$$V=\int_{0}^{4} \pi {\left(4x-x^2\right)}^2 \,dx$$
Looking at the region, it would be problematic to define a horizontal rectangle; the region is bounded on the left and right by the same function. Therefore, we can dismiss the method of shells. The solid has no cavity in the middle, so we can use the method of disks.
First, graph the region and the solid of revolution as shown.
In order to use the Washer Method for a function rotating over x-axis, we need to define the limits of it.The upper limit is given as $$x=2$$. Now we have to define the lower limit.

First, graph the region and the solid of revolution as shown.\n##figure1.gif##
Note that either Wash and Shell method works in this case. Since it will be more convenient to set up a rectangle that is parallel to the y-axis and run it over the x-axis, we proceed to use Shell Method to calculate the volume.
The general formula of cylindrical shells is given as $$2*pi*\int_{a}^{b} x f{\left(x\right)} \,dx$$.
What is a lower limit of the integral?
The upper limit is already given as $$x=2$$.
What is the f(x) of the integral?
$$\sqrt{x}-1-\sqrt{x}=2\sqrt{x}-1$$
$$2*pi*\int_{\frac{1}{4}}^{2} x \left(2\sqrt{x}-1\right) \,dx$$
$$2\pi \left(\frac{4}{5} \frac{x^5}{2}-\frac{x^2}{2}\right)$$ as the limits going from $$x=\frac{1}{4}$$ to $$x=2$$.
$$15.9074$$
The values of $$f(x)=\fracsin^x\left(x\right)}$$ and $$x$$ are listed in Table $$2.2$$. Note: the values in this table were obtained using a calculator and using all the places given in the calculator output.\n##figure2.gif##
As we read down each (sin x)/x column, what number are the values in each column approaching?
The values are approaching $$1$$. Thus, it is fairly reasonable to conclude that $$\lim_{x\to0} \frac{sinx}{x}=1$$. A calculator or computer-generated graph of f(x) $$=$$ (sin x)/x would be similar to the figure shown, and it confirms our estimate.\n##figure3.gif##

According to the Infinite Limits from Positive Integers Theorem, if $$n$$ is a positive even integer, then $$\lim_{x\toa} \frac{1}{{\left(x-a\right)}^n}=+\infty$$.

Given that $$n$$ is a positive even integer, what is the limit?
From the function $$\lim_{x\toa} \frac{1}{{\left(x-a\right)}^n}$$, we know that $$n$$ $$=$$ $$4$$ in $$\lim_{x\to-3} \frac{1}{{\left(x+3\right)}^4}$$. According to the Infinite Limits from Positive Integers Theorem, if $$n$$ is a positive even integer, then $$\lim_{x\toa} \frac{1}{{\left(x-a\right)}^n}=+\infty$$. Since $$4$$ is a positive even integer, this means that $$\lim_{x\to-3} \frac{1}{{\left(x+3\right)}^4}=+\infty$$.
Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $$x$$.
The denominator of $$f(x)=\frac{1}{{\left(x+3\right)}^4}$$ is $${\left(x+3\right)}^4$$. Solve for $${\left(x+3\right)}^4=0$$.
What is $${\left(x+3\right)}^4=0$$?
Take the square root of $$4$$ on both sides of the equation $${\left(x+3\right)}^4=0$$.
Now, the simplified equation is $$x+3=0$$. To solve for $$x$$, substract $$3$$ from both sides of the equation.
The function $$f(x)=\frac{1}{{\left(x+3\right)}^4}$$ has a vertical asymptote of $$x=-3$$

What value is f(x) approaching as $$x$$ approaches -4?
/lim{x,-4**-,f(x)}=0; /lim{x,-4**+,f(x)}=0; $$\lim_{x\to-4} f(x)=0;$$ $$f(-4)=0$$\n##figure3.gif##
/lim{x,-2**-,f(x)} is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$-2$$ from the left.\n/lim{x,-2**+,f(x)} is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$-2$$ from the right.\n$$\lim_{x\to-2} f(x)$$ is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$-2$$ from both sides.\nLocate $$x=-2$$ on the graph and observe the values of f(x) as it approaches that x-value.\n##figure2.gif##
What value is f(x) approaching as $$x$$ approaches -2?
/lim{x,1**+,f(x)}=2. Looking at the right side of the function as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$, we can see that the value of f(x) approaches $$3$$. Remember that there is no difference with an open or closed circle because a limit is the value the graph is approaching from the right and left sides. In this case, we are looking solely at the right side of the function.\n##figure3.gif##
$$f(-2)$$ is the value of f(x) when $$x=-2$$. Locate $$x=-2$$ on the graph and observe the value of f(x). Keep in mind that open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). In other words, it is not a value in the function. Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to $$( \leq $$ or $$ \geq )$$, meaning it is a value in the function.
What value is f(x) when $$x=-2$$?
Because there is an open circle at $$x=-2$$, this means that the function is undefined at that particular x-value. Since we are asked to find $$f(-2)$$, the value would be undefined. If we were asked to find limits, however, there is no difference with an open or closed circle because a limit is the value the graph is approaching from both the right and left sides.\n##figure2.gif##
/lim{x,1**-,f(x)} is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$ from the left. Locate $$x$$ $$=$$ $$1$$ on the graph and observe the values of f(x) as it approaches that x-value from the left.
What value is f(x) approaching as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$ from the left?
/lim{x,1**-,f(x)}=6. Looking at the left side of the function as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$, we can see that the value of f(x) approaches $$6$$. Remember that there is no difference with an open or closed circle because a limit is the value the graph is approaching from the right and left sides. In this case, we are looking solely at the left side of the function.\n##figure2.gif##
/lim{x,1**+,f(x)} is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$ from the right. Locate $$x$$ $$=$$ $$1$$ on the graph and observe the values of f(x) as it approaches that x-value from the right.
What value is f(x) approaching as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$ from the right?
/lim{x,1**+,f(x)}=3. Looking at the right side of the function as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$, we can see that the value of f(x) approaches $$3$$. Remember that there is no difference with an open or closed circle because a limit is the value the graph is approaching from the right and left sides. In this case, we are looking solely at the right side of the function.\n##figure2.gif##
$$\lim_{x\to1} f(x)$$ is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$ from both sides. Locate $$x=1$$ on the graph and observe the values of f(x) as it approaches that x-value from both sides.
What value is f(x) approaching as $$x$$ approaches 1? If the limit does not exist, write 'DNE'.
$$\lim_{x\to1} f(x)$$ DNE. There are two different points that f(x) is approaching as $$x$$ approaches 1: $$6$$ (from the left side of the function) and $$3$$ (from the right side of the function). Because the y-values do not approach any one single value, the limit does not exist.\n##figure2.gif##
The values of $$f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x}-2}{x-4}$$ as $$x$$ approaches $$4$$ are listed in Table $$2.3$$. Note: the values in this table were obtained using a calculator and using all the places given in the calculator output.\n##figure2.gif##
As we read down each (sqrt(x) - 2)/(x - 4) column, what number are the values in each column approaching? Round to the nearest hundredths place.
After inspecting the table, we see that the functional values less than $$4$$ appear to be decreasing toward $$0.25$$ whereas the functional values greater than $$4$$ appear to be increasing toward $$0.25$$. We conclude that $$/lim{x,4,(sqrt(x)$$ - 2)/(x - $$4)=0.25$$. We confirm this estimate using the graph of f(x)=(sqrt(x) - 2)/(x - 4) shown in the following figure.\n##figure3.gif##
f(1) is the value of f(x) when $$x=1$$. Locate $$x=1$$ on the graph and observe the value of f(x). Keep in mind that open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). In other words, it is not a value in the function. Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to $$( \leq $$ or $$ \geq )$$, meaning it is a value in the function.
What value is f(x) when $$x=1$$?
When $$x=1$$, there are two points that f(x) approaches: one is at a closed circle (from the left) and the other is at an open circle (from the right). Because open circles indicate that the function is undefined at that particular x-value, the f(x) value when $$x=1$$ would be at the closed circle where $$f(x)=6$$. If we were asked to find limits, however, there would be no difference with an open or closed circle because a limit is the value the graph is approaching from both the right and left sides.\n##figure2.gif##
/lim{x,3**-,f(x)} is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$3$$ from the left.\n/lim{x,3**+,f(x)} is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$3$$ from the right.\n$$\lim_{x\to3} f(x)is$$ the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$3$$ from both sides.\nLocate $$x=3$$ on the graph and observe the values of f(x) as it approaches that x-value.\n##figure2.gif##
What value is f(x) approaching as $$x$$ approaches 3? If it is $$\infty$$, write $$-\infty$$ or $$+\infty$$. If it does not exist, write 'DNE'.
/lim{x,3**-,f(x)})=-inf; /lim{x,3**+,f(x)}=-inf; $$\lim_{x\to3} f(x)=-\infty$$. As $$x$$ approaches $$3$$, the values of f(x) continuously go down into the negatives.\n##figure3.gif##
f(3) is the value of f(x) when $$x=3$$. Locate $$x=3$$ on the graph and observe the value of f(x).
What value is f(x) when $$x=3$$? If the value is undefined, write "undefined".
As $$x$$ approaches $$3$$, the value of f(x) does not approach any one single value, meaning that f(3) is undefined.\n##figure2.gif##
/lim{x,-2**+,f(x)} is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$-2$$ from the right. Locate $$x$$ $$=$$ $$-2$$ on the graph and observe the values of f(x) from the right.\n##figure2.gif##
What value is f(x) approaching when $$x$$ approaches $$-2$$ from the right? If the limit is $$\infty$$, write $$-\infty$$ or $$+\infty$$. If the limit does not exist, write 'DNE'.
/lim{x,-2**+,f(x)}=+inf. Looking at the right side of the function as $$x$$ approaches $$-2$$, we can see that the values of f(x) continuously goes up into the positives.\n##figure3.gif##
$$\lim_{x\to6} f(x)$$ is the value of f(x) as $$x$$ approaches $$6$$ from both sides. Locate $$x=6$$ on the graph and observe the value of f(x) from both sides.\n##figure2.gif##
What value is f(x) approaching when $$x$$ approaches $$6$$ from both sides? If the limit is $$\infty$$, write $$-\infty$$ or $$+\infty$$. If the limit does not exist, write 'DNE'.
$$\lim_{x\to6} f(x)$$ DNE because /lim{x,6**-,f(x)}=2 and /lim{x,6**+,f(x)}=5.\n##figure3.gif##

What value is f(x) approaching when $$x$$ approaches $$1$$ from the right side? If the limit is $$\infty$$, write $$-\infty$$ or $$+\infty$$. If the limit does not exist, write 'DNE'.
/lim{x,1**+,f(x)}=2. Looking at the right side of the function as $$x$$ approaches $$1$$, we can see that the value of f(x) approaches $$2$$. Remember that there is no difference with an open or closed circle because a limit is the value the graph is approaching from the right and left sides. In this case, we are looking solely at the right side of the function.\n##figure3.gif##
Look at the g(x) values as the x-values approach $$-1$$ from either side to determine the limit of the function.
What number do the g(x) values approach as the x-values approach -1?
Despite the fact that $$g(-1)$$ $$=$$ $$4$$, as the x-values approach $$-1$$ from either side, the g(x) values approach $$3$$. Therefore, $$lim_x$$ → $$-1$$ g(x) $$=$$ $$3$$. Note that we can determine this limit without even knowing the algebraic expression of the function.
The values of $$f(x)=sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ as $$x$$ approaches $$0$$ are listed in Table $$2.5$$. Note: the values in this table were obtained using a calculator and using all the places given in the calculator output.\n##figure2.gif##
As we read down each $$sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ column, are the values in each column approaching one single number?
After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the y-values do not seem to approach any one single value. It appears the limit does not exist. Before drawing this conclusion, let’s take a more systematic approach. Take the following sequence of x-values approaching 0: $$\frac{2}{\pi}$$, $$\frac{2}{3} \pi$$, $$\frac{2}{5} \pi$$, $$\frac{2}{7} \pi$$, $$\frac{2}{9} \pi$$, $$\frac{2}{11} \pi$$, ... The corresponding y-values are $$1$$, $$-1$$, $$1$$, $$-1$$, $$1$$, $$-1$$, ... At this point we can indeed conclude that $$lim_x$$ → $$0$$ $$sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ does not exist. Thus, we would write $$lim_x$$ → $$0$$ $$sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ DNE. The graph of f(x) $$=$$ $$sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ is shown in the figure and gives a clearer picture of the behavior of $$sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ as $$x$$ approaches $$0$$. You can see that $$sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ oscillates ever more wildly between $$-1$$ and $$1$$ as $$x$$ approaches $$0$$.\n##figure3.gif##
The functional values are shown in the table. Observe that for values of $$x$$ less than $$2$$, we use $$f(x)=x+1$$. The values in this table were obtained using a calculator and using all the places given in the calculator output.\n##figure2.gif##
As we read down the $$f(x)=x+1$$ column, what number are the values approaching?
Based on the table, we can conclude that /lim{x,2**-,f(x)}=3. The figure shows a graph of f(x) and reinforces our conclusion about the limit.\n##figure3.gif##
The functional values are shown in the table. Observe that for values of $$x$$ greater than $$2$$, we use $$f(x)=x^2-4$$. The values in this table were obtained using a calculator and using all the places given in the calculator output.\n##figure2.gif##

As we read down the $$\frac{1}{x}$$ column, what are the values approaching?
The values of $$\frac{1}{x}$$ decrease without bound as $$x$$ approaches $$0$$ from the left. As such, we conclude that /lim{x,0**-,1/x}=-inf. The graph of $$f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$$ in the figure confirms these conclusions.\n##figure2.gif##

As we read down the $$\frac{1}{x}$$ columns, does /lim{x,0**-,1/x} and /lim{x,0**+,1/x} approach the same values?
Since /lim{x,0**-,1/x}=-inf and /lim{x,0**+,1/x}=+inf have different values, we conclude that $$/lim(x$$ , $$0$$, $$\frac{1}{x}$$ )DNE. The graph of $$f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$$ in the figure confirms these conclusions.\n##figure2.gif##

Substitution does not give us an indeterminate form therefore we have to look for another approach.

$$0^3=0$$
Let $$y=x^{\frac{1}{x}}$$. Using one-to-one property of logarithms, we obtain $$ln(y)=\ln(x^{\frac{1}{x}})$$. According to the Power Properties of Logarithms, the expression can be written as $$ln(y)=\frac{1}{x} \ln(x)=\frac{\ln(x)}{x}$$
If we immediately evaluate the limit of the given function, the result would be $${\infty}^0$$ which is not the indeterminate form we need in order to apply L’Hôpital’s Rule.

In order to determine which function grows more quickly than the other as $$x$$ approaches $$infinty$$, we can choose to set up ONE of these two limits $$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{f{\left(x\right)}}{g{\left(x\right)}}$$ or $$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{g{\left(x\right)}}{f{\left(x\right)}}$$. If evaluating the limits results in $$0$$, the function in the denominator is greater and grows faster than the function on the numerator. If evaluating the limits results in $$\infty$$, the function in the numerator is is greater and grows fastethan the function on the denominator. In this case, let's use $$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{f{\left(x\right)}}{g{\left(x\right)}}=\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}$$ .

Does direct substitution of this limit yield any required indeterminate form?
L'Hôpital's rule is a technique to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms: $$\frac{0}{0}$$, $$\frac{\infty}{\infty}$$ or $$\frac{-\infty}{\infty}$$. Since $$\frac{1}{0}$$ is not an indeterminate form, we then have to try another approach. In addition, this problem can be double-checked with a graphing calculator to prove this point.
$$\lim_{x\to0} cos\left(x\right) \frac{1}{x}$$
What is a value of the limit as $$x$$ approaches $$0$$ from the right side of the origin?
Even if we tried to apply L’Hôpital’s Rule ignoring the fact that this limit does not meet L’Hôpital’s Rule condition, the answer would still be wrong eventually.We can double check by looking at the graph of the limit.
$$\lim_{x\to0} \frac{\frac{d}{dx} cos\left(x\right)}{\frac{d}{dx} x}=\lim_{x\to0} \frac{-sin\left(x\right)}{1}$$
$$\frac{-sin\left(0\right)}{1}=0$$
The vertex is the turning point of the graph. We can see that the vertex is at $$(3,1)$$.
Because this parabola opens upward, the axis of symmetry is the vertical line that intersects the parabola at the vertex. So the axis of symmetry is $$x=3$$.
This parabola does not cross the $$x-$$ axis, so it has no zeros.
The parabola crosses the $$y-$$ axis at $$(0,7)$$ so this is the y-intercept.
Since we know that the quadratic is positive, the minima must be at the vertex. The function is in vertex form, so we know that the range of the function is greater than or equal to $$\frac{8}{11}$$. This can be written as $$f(x) \geq \frac{8}{11}$$
Quadratic functions always have a domain that consists of all real numbers. This can be written as $$-\infty<x<\infty$$.
We must first set g(x) equal to $$0$$ and solve for $$x$$. The equation we now have is $$0=13+x^2-6x$$
We'll notice that this equation has no real solutions because the discriminant $$b^2-4ac$$ is less than $$0$$. Thus, there is no x-intercept of the equation.
To solve for the y-intercept, we must merely plug in $$0$$ for $$x$$ in the equation. We now have $$g(x)=13$$. Thus, the y-intercept is $$(0,13)$$.
To determine the maximum height of the rock, we must find the x-value of the the vertex. Since we already have the equation, we can use the formula $$\frac{-b}{2} a$$ to find the x-value. $$\frac{-90}{-32}=3$$. So, the ball reaches its maximum height at $$3$$ seconds.
To determine the maximum height of the rock, we must find the y-value of the vertex. Since we already know that the x-value is $$3$$, we simply plug in $$3$$ for $$x$$ into the equation. We now get $$256$$ as the y-value. This means that the maximum height of the ball is $$256$$ feet.
To find when the rock hits the ground, we can simply find the x-intercept that is greater than $$0$$. To do this, we must set h(x) equal to as follows: $$0=-16t^2+96t+112$$. After solving for $$t$$, we will get $$7$$. This means that the ball hits the ground after $$7$$ seconds.

We can see the graph of g is the graph of $$f(x)=x^2$$ shifted to the left $$2$$ and down $$3$$, giving a formula in the form $$g(x)={a\left(x-\left(-2\right)\right)}^2-3={a\left(x+2\right)}^2-3$$.
Substituting the coordinates of a point on the curve, such as $$(0,-1)$$, we can solve for the stretch factor. We then get $$a=\frac{1}{2}$$.
In standard form, the algebraic model for this graph is $$g(x)=\frac{1}{{2\left(x+2\right)}^2}-3$$.
To write this in general polynomial form, we can expand the formula and simplify terms.

The horizontal coordinate of the vertex will be at $$h=\frac{-b}{2a}$$. What is $$h$$?
The vertical coordinate is at $$k=f(h)$$. What is f(h)?
Rewriting into standard form, the stretch factor will be the same as the a in the original quadratic. First, find the horizontal coordinate of the vertex. Then find the vertical coordinate of the vertex. Substitute the values into standard form, using the "a" from the general form. $$f(x)={ax}^2+bx+c$$ with numerical values of a, $$b$$, and c, what is f?
As with any quadratic function, the domain is all real numbers.
Because a is negative, the parabola opens downward and has a maximum value. We need to determine the maximum value.
The x-coordinate is equal to $$\frac{-b}{2} a$$.
What is the x-coordinate?
The maximum value is the vertex's y-coordinate. When $$x=\frac{9}{10}$$, $$f=$$?
First, use a diagram such as the attached one to record the given information. It is also helpful to introduce a temporary variable, W, to represent the width of the garden and the length of the fence section parallel to the backyard fence.\n##figure1.gif##
We know we have only $$80$$ feet of fence available, and $$L+W+L=80$$, or more simply, $$2L+W=80$$. This allows us to represent the width, W, in terms of L with the equation $$W=80-2L$$.
We know the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, so $$A=LW=L(80-2L)=80L-2L^2$$.
In general form, $$A(L)=-2L^2+80L$$
The quadratic has a negative leading coefficient, so the graph will open downward, and the vertex will be the maximum value for the area. In finding the vertex, we must be careful because the equation is not written in standard polynomial form with decreasing powers. This is why we rewrote the function in general form for the last step. Since a is the coefficient of the squared term, $$a=-2, b=80$$, and $$v=0$$.
The x-coordinate is equal to $$\frac{-b}{2} a$$.
Since $$b=80$$ and $$a=-2$$, what is the x-coordinate of the vertex?
Knowing that the x-coordinate of the vertex is $$20$$, what is the y-coordinate of the vertex?
The maximum value of the function is an area of $$800$$ square feet, which occurs when $$L=20$$ feet. When the shorter sides are $$20$$ feet, there is $$40$$ feet of fencing left for the longer side. To maximize the area, she should enclose the garden so the two shorter sides have length $$20$$ feet and the longer side parallel to the existing fence has length $$40$$ feet.
Revenue is the amount of money a company brings in. In this case, the revenue can be found by multiplying the price per subscription times the number of subscribers, or quantity. We can introduce variables, $$p$$ for price per subscription and Q for quantity, giving us the equation $$Revenue=pQ$$.
Because the number of subscribers changes with the price, we need to find a relationship between the variables. We know that currently $$𝑝=30p=30$$ and $$𝑄=84, 000.Q=84, 000$$. We also know that if the price rises to $32, the newspaper would lose 5,000 subscribers, giving a second pair of values, $$𝑝=32p=32$$ and $$𝑄=79, 000.Q=79, 000$$. From this we can find a linear equation relating the two quantities. The slope will be
The slope is equal to (79,000-84,000)/(32-30). What is the simplified answer for slope?
This tells us the paper will lose 2,500 subscribers for each dollar they raise the price. We can then solve for the y-intercept by subsituting in $$Q=84, 000$$ and $$p=30$$.
This gives us the linear equation Q=-2,500p+159,000 relating cost and subscribers. We now return to our revenue equation by plugging in the new formula for Q. The new equation is Revenue $$=$$ $$-2500p^2+159000p$$
To find the price that will maximize revenue for the newspaper, we can find the vertex.
What is the first coordinate of the vertex?
The model tells us that the maximum revenue will occur if the newspaper charges $$\$31.80$$ for a subscription. To find what the maximum revenue is, we evaluate the revenue function at the vertex.
Find the $$y$$ intercept by evaluating f(0).
To find the $$x$$ intercept, factor f(x) to find the $$x$$ values when $$f(x)=0$$.
Because the quadratic is not easily factorable in this case, we solve for the intercepts by first rewriting the quadratic in standard form.
The standard form is $$f(x)={2\left(x+1\right)}^2-6$$.
Finally, set $$f(x)=0$$ and solve for the $$x$$ values.
The general form has the formula $$g(x)={ax}^2+bx+c$$.
The standard form is $$g(x)={a\left(x-h\right)}^2+k$$.

A determinant of zero means that either the system has no solution or it has an infinite number of solutions. We use the process of elimination to see which one.
When there are like terms in both equation, we can add or subtract the common terms so that we are left with only one variable that we can solve.
Multiply the third equation by $$-2$$ and add the result to the first equation.
Adding the scaled third equation with the first equation, we obtain the equation $$0=-6$$, which is false. Therefore, the system has no solution..

Finding the determinant of a 2×2 matrix is straightforward, but finding the determinant of a 3×3 matrix is more complicated. One method is to augment the 3×3 matrix with a repetition of the first two columns, giving a 3×5 matrix. Then we calculate the sum of the products of entries down each of the three diagonals (upper left to lower right), and subtract the products of entries up each of the three diagonals (lower left to upper right). This is more easily understood with a visual and an example.\nFor a matrix $$A=\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\ a_3 & b_3 & c_3 \end{bmatrix}$$,\n$$1$$. Augment A with the first $$2$$ columns, det(A)=|(a_1,b_1,c_1),(a_2,b_2,c_2),(a_3,b_3,c_3)|(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),(a_3,b_3)|\n$$2$$.

We have that $$D=|(10, 0.2), (5, 0.1)|$$. A common trick is to multiply a row or column by a constant so that we can utilize other properties later. Which property, from $$1$$ to $$6$$, is that?
Using property $$6$$, we multiply the second column by $$50$$ from $$\begin{bmatrix} 0.2 \\ 0.1 \end{bmatrix}$$ to $$\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}$$. This would mean that the determinant would be multiplied by $$50$$ later on.
We now have that $$D=|(10,10),(5,5)|$$. We realize that both columns are identical. Which property, from $$1$$ to $$6$$, can we use here?
What is D? We thus observe that by extension of Property $$3$$ and $$6$$, that if $$2$$ rows or columns are a scalar multiple of each other, that the determinant is zero as well.

Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is $$147$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$a+c=147$$
Because the total amount of money made was $1302 and adult tickets are $11 and childrens $8 we can determine that the second equation is $$11a+8c=1302$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=147-a$$
We can plug in $$c=147-a$$ using the second equation to get $$11a+8\left(147-a\right)=1302$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in C would be $$3a+1176=1302$$. We now isolate the variable "a" and get $$3a=126$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$3$$ to get $$a=42$$. There are $$42$$ adult tickets.
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$42+c=147$$ which we can determine c to be $$105$$.
Let's use "m" as the number of Main Level seats and "t" as the number of Terrace Level seats. The total number of people combined is $$16$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$m+t=16$$
Because the total amount of money made was $804 and Main Level seats are $69 and Terrace Level seats $39 we can determine that the second equation is $$69m+39t=804$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate $$m$$. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$m=16-t$$
We can plug in $$m=16-t$$ using the second equation to get $$\operatorname{69}\left(16-t\right)+39t=804$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in would be -30t+1,104=804. We now isolate the variable "t" and get $$-30t=-300$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$-30$$ to get $$t=10$$.
After solving for "t", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$m+10=16$$ which we can determine "m" to be $$6$$.
Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is $$253$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$a+c=253$$
Because the total amount of money made was $2,771 and adult tickets are $15 and childrens $7 we can determine that the second equation is $$15a+7c=2, 771$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=253-a$$
We can plug in $$c=253-a$$ using the second equation to get $$15a+7\left(253-a\right)=2, 771$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be 8a+1,771=2,771. We now isolate the variable "a" and get $$8a=1000$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$8$$ to get $$a=125$$.
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$125+c=253$$ which we can determine "c" to be $$128$$.
Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is $$312$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$a+c=312$$
Because the total amount of money made was $2,204 and adult tickets are $12 and childrens $5 we can determine that the second equation is $$12a+5c=2, 204$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=312-a$$
We can plug in $$c=312-a$$ using the second equation to get $$12a+5\left(312-a\right)=2, 204$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be $$7a+1560=2, 204$$. We now isolate the variable "a" and get $$7a=644$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$7$$ to get $$a=92$$.
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$92+c=312$$ which we can determine "c" to be $$220$$.
Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is $$553$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$a+c=553$$
Because the total amount of money made was $3,936 and adult tickets are $9 and childrens $6 we can determine that the second equation is $$9a+6c=3, 936$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=553-a$$
We can plug in $$c=553-a$$ using the second equation to get $$9a+6\left(553-a\right)=3, 936$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be 3a+3,318=3,936. We now isolate the variable "a" and get $$3a=618$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$3$$ to get $$a=206$$.
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$206+c=553$$ which we can determine "c" to be $$347$$.
Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is 1,363, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$a+c=1, 363$$
Because the total amount of money made was $12,146. and adult tickets are $12 and childrens $7 we can determine that the second equation is $$12a+7c=12, 146$$.
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=1, 363-a$$
We can plug in $$c=1, 363-a$$ using the second equation to get $$12a+7(1,363-a)=12,146$$.
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be 5a+9,541=12,146. We now isolate the variable "a" and get $$5a=2, 605$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$5$$ to get $$a=521$$.
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$521+c=1, 363$$ which we can determine "c" to be $$842$$.
Let's use "q" as the number of quarters and "d" as the number of dimes. Because the number of quarters is $$3$$ more than $$2$$ times the number of dims, we can identify the first equation to be $$q=2d+3$$.
Because the total amount of money is $$\$8.55$$ and quarters are $$\$0.25$$ and dimes are $$\$0.10$$ we can determine that the second equation is $$0.25q+0.1d=8.55$$
We can plug in $$q=2d+3$$ using the second equation to get $$\operatorname{0.25}\left(2d+3\right)+0.1d=8.55$$
We can determine that the second equation simplified would be $$0.6d+0.75=8.55$$. We now isolate the variable "d" and get $$0.6d=7.8$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$0.6$$ to get $$d=13$$. There are $$13$$ dimes.
After solving for "d", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$q=2\left(13\right)+3$$ which we can determine $$n$$ to be $$29$$.
The relevant variables here are Lucinda's dimes and quarters.

Additionally, the last sentence of the problem tells us that $$3q+18=d$$.
Solve the two equations as a normal system of equations to find the number of dimes and quarters (equal to the values of $$d$$ and q respectively.)
The relevant variables here are the $10 and $20 bills. We know that the total value is $460. Using a and $$b$$ to represent the number of $$10$$ and $$20$$ dollar bills respectively, this means that $$10a+20b=460$$. Furthermore, since there are $$30$$ bills in total, $$a+b=30$$.

Let's use "q" as the number of quarters and "n" as the number of nickels. Because the number of nickels is $$6$$ less than $$3$$ times the number of quarters, we can identify the first equation to be $$n=3q-6$$.
Because the total amount of money is $$\$7.30$$ and quarters are $$\$0.25$$ and nickels are $$\$0.05$$ we can determine that the second equation is $$0.25q+0.05n=7.3$$
We can plug in $$n=3q-6$$ using the second equation to get $$0.25q+\operatorname{0.05}\left(3q-6\right)=7.3$$
We can determine that the second equation simplified would be $$0.4q-0.3=7.3$$. We now isolate the variable "q" and get $$0.4q=7.6$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$0.4$$ to get $$q=19$$. There are $$19$$ quarters.
After solving for "q", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$n=3(19)-6$$ which we can determine $$n$$ to be $$51$$.

Solve the two equations as a normal system of equations to find the values of the two variables.
Let's use "n" as the amount in pounds of nuts and "c" as the amount in pounds of chocolate chips. The total weight combined is $$20$$ pounds, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$n+c=20$$
Because the total amount of money was 20*$7.60 $$=$$ $152 and nuts are $$\$9.00$$ per pound and chocolate chips $2 per pound, we can determine that the second equation is $$9n+2c=152$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=20-n$$
We can plug in $$c=20-n$$ using the second equation to get $$9n+2\left(20-n\right)=152$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be $$7n+40=152$$. We now isolate the variable "n" and get $$7n=112$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$7$$ to get $$n=16$$. There are $$16$$ pounds of nuts.
After solving for "n", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$16+c=20$$ which we can determine c to be $$4$$.
Let's use "t" as the 25% solution and "f" as the 50% solution. The total amount of solution combined is $$200$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$t+f=200$$
Because the total amount is 40% of $$200$$ (80) and there are 25% solutions and 50% solutions, we can determine that the second equation is $$0.25t+0.5f=80$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate $$t$$. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$t=200-f$$
We can plug in $$t=200-f$$ using the second equation to get $$\operatorname{0.25}\left(200-f\right)+0.5f=80$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in $$t$$ would be $$50+0.25f=80$$. We now isolate the variable "f" and get $$0.25f=30$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$0.25$$ to get $$f=120$$. There is $$120$$ mililiters of 50% solution.
After solving for "f", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$t+120=200$$ which we can determine $$t$$ to be $$80$$ mililiters.
Let's use "s" as stocks and "b" as the bonds. The total amount of money combined is $40,000, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$s+b=40, 000$$
Because the total amount is $$0.071(40,000)$$ and an interest rate of 8% on stocks and 3% on bonds, we can determine that the second equation is $$0.08s+0.03b=2, 840$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate $$b$$. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$b=40, 000-s$$
We can plug in $$b=40, 000-s$$ using the second equation to get $$0.08s+0.03(40,000-s)=2,840$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "b" would be 0.05s+1,200=2,840. We now isolate the variable "s" and get $$0.05s=1640$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$0.05$$ to get $$s=32, 800$$.
After solving for "s", we can plug that value into the first equation to get 32,800+b=40,000 which we can determine $$b$$ to be 7,200.
Let's use "b" as bank loan and "f" as the federal loan. The total amount of money combined is $21,540, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$b+f=21, 540$$
Because the total amount is how much she paid $$(\$1, 669.68)$$ and there is an interest rate of $$10.5\%$$ from bank and $$5.9\%$$ from federal, we can determine that the second equation is $$0.105b+0.059f=1, 669.68$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate $$b$$. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$b=21, 540-f$$
We can plug in $$b=21, 540-f$$ using the second equation to get $$0.105(21,540-f)f+0.059=1,669.68$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "b" would be $$2, 261.7-0.046f=1, 669.68$$. We now isolate the variable "f" and get $$-0.046f=-592.02$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$-0.046$$ to get $$f=12, 870$$.
After solving for "f", we can plug that value into the first equation to get b+12,870=21,540 which we can determine $$b$$ to be 8,670.
Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is $$1650$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$a+c=1, 650$$
Because the total amount of money made was $47,150 and adult tickets are $35 and childrens $15 we can determine that the second equation is $$35a+15c=47, 150$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=1, 650-a$$
We can plug in $$c=1, 650-a$$ using the second equation to get $$35a+15(1,650-a)=47,150$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be 20a+24,750=47,150. We now isolate the variable "a" and get $$20a=22, 400$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$20$$ to get $$a=1, 120$$.
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get 1,120+c=1,650 which we can determine "c" to be $$530$$.
Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is $$300$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$a+c=300$$
Because the total amount of money made was $17,200 and adult tickets are $70 and childrens $50 we can determine that the second equation is $$70a+50c=17, 200$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=300-a$$
We can plug in $$c=300-a$$ using the second equation to get $$70a+\operatorname{50}\left(300-a\right)=17, 200$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be $$20a+600=17, 200$$. We now isolate the variable "a" and get $$20a=16, 600$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$20$$ to get $$a=83$$.
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$83+c=300$$ which we can determine "c" to be $$217$$.
Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is $$72$$, therefore we can determine that the first equation is $$a+c=72$$
Because the total amount of money made was $1,200 and adult tickets are $22 and childrens $10 we can determine that the second equation is $$22a+10c=1, 200$$
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get $$c=72-a$$
We can plug in $$c=72-a$$ using the second equation to get $$22a+\operatorname{10}\left(72-a\right)=1, 200$$
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be $$12a+720=1, 200$$. We now isolate the variable "a" and get $$12a=480$$. Then, we can divide both sides by $$12$$ to get $$a=40$$.
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get $$40+c=72$$ which we can determine "c" to be $$32$$.

This question is actually a cool application of the addition rule. We note that the addition rule states that P(O OR R)=P(O)+P(R)-P(O AND R). However, we can algebraically manipulate this to get P(O AND R)=P(O)+P(R)-P(O OR R), which is what we want to solve for.

What is the total area?
Perimeter of S is $$b+a+b+\pi r=2b+a+\pi \frac{a}{2}$$ since $$r=\frac{a}{2}$$ in the semi-circle.

If $$w=0$$, then $$2w^2+4w h=0 \neq 32$$, so $$w \neq 0$$.
$$2w^2+4w h=32$$. $$w \left(w+2h\right)=16$$. $$\frac{16}{w}=w+2h$$.
Express $$\frac{16}{w}=w+2h$$ in the form of $$h$$. What is the result?
Substitute $$h=\frac{8}{w}-\frac{w}{2}$$ to $$V=w^2 h$$. What is the volume expressed in w only?
w must be nonnegative since it represents width, and since $$w \neq 0$$, $$w>0$$.
$$h \geq 0$$, so $$\frac{8}{w}-\frac{w}{2} \geq 0$$
Multiply w on both sides, we get $$8-\frac{w^2}{2} \geq 0$$.
What is the range of w?
What is $$w \leq 4$$ in interval notation?
$$2w^2+4w h=32$$. $$w \left(w+2h\right)=16$$, so $$w^2+2h w-16=0$$.
Using the Quadratic Formula, $$w=\frac{\left(-2h\pm \sqrt{4h^2+64}\right)}{2}=\frac{\left(-2h\pm \sqrt{4\left(h^2+16\right)}\right)}{2}=-h\pm \sqrt{h^2+16}$$
$$h^2+16>h^2$$ is equivalent to $$\sqrt{h^2+16}>\sqrt{h^2}=h$$. Thus, $$-h-\sqrt{h^2+16}<0$$. Since $$w \geq 0$$, the only solution is $$w=-h+\sqrt{h^2+16}$$
Substitute $$w=-h+\sqrt{h^2+16}$$ into $$V=w^2 h$$, what is V expressed in $$h$$?

Note that triangle1 is similar to triangle2 by AAA\n##figure2.gif##
Ratio of lengths of similar shapes are equal, so $$\frac{b}{4-b}=\frac{3-a}{a}$$
$$\frac{b}{4-b}=\frac{3-a}{a}$$ is equivalent to $$a=\frac{3}{4} \left(4-b\right)$$ by simplification.

Substitute $$a=\frac{3}{4} \left(4-b\right)$$ into $$a b$$, what is the area expressed in the form of $$b$$?

Do all the terms in the expression have common denominator?
Yes, $$\frac{11x+28}{x+4}$$ and $$\frac{x^2}{x+4}$$ shared the same common denominator of $$x+4$$.
Since all of fractions in the expression have the least common denominator $$x+4$$, we can add the numerators.
What is the sum of numerators for $$\frac{11x+28}{x+4}$$ and $$\frac{x^2}{x+4}$$?
We can factor the sum of numerator that we yield from step above to check if we can simplify the expression.
Factor $$x^2+11x+28$$.
In order to factor $$x^2+11x+28$$, you can use reverse foiling, completing square or quadratic formula. In here we can use reverse-foiling. $$\left(x+a\right) \left(x+b\right)=x^2+\left(a+b\right) x+ab$$. In this case, we get $$a b=28$$ and $$a+b=11$$. Assume both a and $$b$$ are integers, $$a=4$$ and $$b=7$$ is only one possible combination that satisfies $$a b=28$$ and $$a+b=11$$. So you can factor $$x^2+11x+28$$ as?
From above steps, we get the sum of numerators is $$\left(x+4\right) \left(x+7\right)$$ and the denominator is $$x+4$$. So we can rewrite $$\frac{11x+28}{x+4}+\frac{x^2}{x+4}$$ as $$\frac{\left(x+4\right) \left(x+7\right)}{x+4}$$
Are there any ways to simplify $$\frac{\left(x+4\right) \left(x+7\right)}{x+4}$$?
What is the greatest common factor shared by both numerator and denominator in $$\frac{\left(x+4\right) \left(x+7\right)}{x+4}$$?
As the final step, we cancel out $$x-4$$ on both numerator and denominator, what is the simplified form of $$\frac{\left(x+4\right) \left(x+7\right)}{x+4}$$?
Note that the expression $$\frac{11x+28}{x+4}+\frac{x^2}{x+4}$$ and $$x+7$$ are different because the domain of $$\frac{11x+28}{x+4}+\frac{x^2}{x+4}$$ does not include $$x=-4$$. The domain of $$x+7$$ includes $$x=-4$$. Strictly speaking, $$\frac{11x+28}{x+4}+\frac{x^2}{x+4}$$ equals $$x+7$$ excluding the domain $$x=-4$$.
The expression does not have a common denominator, so we need to find the common denominator.

The answer of $$\frac{7m+25}{\left(m+3\right) \left(m+4\right)}$$ is simplified because $$7m+25$$ cannot be factored.

What is the difference of numerators for $$\frac{2x}{\left(x+2\right) \left(x-2\right)}-\frac{x-2}{x+2} \left(x-2\right)$$?
According to the above steps, we can rewrite $$\frac{2x}{x^2-4}-\frac{1}{x+2}$$ as $$\frac{x+2}{\left(x+2\right) \left(x-2\right)}$$, are there any ways to simplify the new expression?
Yes, we can there is a common factor of $$x+2$$ in both numerator and denominator of $$\frac{x+2}{x+2} \left(x-2\right)$$. By cancelling out $$x+2$$ in both numerator and denominator, what do we get?
The expression does not have a common denominator, so we need to find the common denominator.
Since the one of the denominator is quadratic, we can try to factor the it. What is the linear factor form of $$z^2-9$$?
We can rewrite $$\frac{6z}{z^2-9}$$ as $$\frac{6z}{\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)}$$, what is the least common denominator for $$\frac{3}{z+3}-\frac{6z}{\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)}$$?
Rewrite each rational expression as an equivalent rational expression with the LCD.
Since $$\frac{6z}{z^2-9}=\frac{6z}{\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)}$$ already has LCD as denominator, we need to find the equivalent rational expression with the LCD $$\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)$$ for $$\frac{3}{z+3}$$.
Find the equivalent rational expression with the LCD $$\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)$$ for $$\frac{3}{z+3}$$.

What is the difference of numerators for (3*(z-3))/((z+3)*(z-3)))-((6*z)/((z+3)*(z-3)))?
According to the above steps, we can $$\operatorname{rewrite}\left(\frac{3}{z+3}\right)-\frac{6z}{z^2-9}$$ as $$\frac{\left(-3z-9\right)}{\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)}$$, are there any ways to simplify the new expression?
Yes, we can further factor the numerator $$-3z-9$$ as $$-3\left(z+3\right)$$. So $$\frac{\left(-3z-9\right)}{\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)}$$ can be rewritten as $$\frac{\left(-3\left(z+3\right)\right)}{\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)}$$. What is the simplified form of $$\frac{\left(-3\left(z+3\right)\right)}{\left(z+3\right) \left(z-3\right)}$$?
Do all the terms in the expression have common denominator?
Yes, $$\frac{9x+14}{x+7}$$ and $$\frac{x^2}{x+7}$$ shared the same common denominator of $$x+7$$.
Since all of fractions in the expression have common denominator, we can add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator.
What is the sum of numerators for $$\frac{9x+14}{x+7}$$ and $$\frac{x^2}{x+7}$$?
We can factor the sum of numerator we yield from step above to check if we can simplify the expression.
Factor $$x^2+9x+14$$.
In order to $$\operatorname{factor}\left(x^2\right)+9x+14$$, you can use reverse foiling, completing square or quadratic formula. In here we can use reverse-foiling. $$\left(x+a\right) \left(x+b\right)=x^2+\left(a+b\right) x+ab$$. In this case, we get $$a b=14$$ and $$a+b=9$$. Assume both a and $$b$$ are integers, $$a=2$$ and $$b=7$$ is only one possible combination that satisfies $$a b=14$$ and $$a+b=9$$. So you can factor $$x^2+9x+14$$ as ?
From above steps, we get the sum of numerator is $$\left(x+2\right) \left(x+7\right)$$ and the denominator is $$x+7$$. So we can rewrite((9*x+14)/(x+7))+((x**2)/(x+7))as $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x+7\right)}{x+7}$$
Are there any ways to simplify $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x+7\right)}{x+7}$$?
What is the greatest common factor shared by the numerator and denominator in $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x+7\right)}{x+7}$$?
As the final step, we cancel out $$x+7$$ on both numerator and denominator, what is the simplified form of $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x+7\right)}{x+7}$$?
Note that the $$\operatorname{expression}\left(\frac{9x+14}{x+7}\right)+\frac{x^2}{x+7}$$ and $$x+2$$ are different because the domain of $$\frac{9x+14}{x+7}+\frac{x^2}{x+7}$$ does not include $$x=-7$$. The domain of $$x+2$$ includes $$x=-7$$. Strictly speaking, $$\frac{9x+14}{x+7}+\frac{x^2}{x+7}$$ equals $$x+2$$ excluding the domain $$x=-7$$.
Do all the terms in the expression have common denominator?
Yes, $$\frac{x^2+8x}{x+5}$$ and $$\frac{15}{x+5}$$ shared the same common denominator of $$x+5$$.
Since all of fractions in the expression have common denominator, we can add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator.
What is the sum of numerators for $$\frac{x^2+8x}{x+5}$$ and $$\frac{15}{x+5}$$?
We can factor the sum of numerator we yield from step above to check if we can simplify the expression.
Factor $$x^2+8x+15$$.
In order to factor $$x^2+8x+15$$, you can use reverse foiling, completing square or quadratic formula. In here we can use reverse-foiling. $$\left(x+a\right) \left(x+b\right)=x^2+\left(a+b\right) x+ab$$. In this case, we get $$a b=15$$ and $$a+b=8$$. Assume both a and $$b$$ are integers, $$a=3$$ and $$b=5$$ is only one possible combination that satisfies $$a b=15$$ and $$a+b=8$$. So you can factor $$x^2+8x+15$$ as ?
From above steps, we get the sum of numerator is $$\left(x+3\right) \left(x+5\right)$$ and the denominator is $$x+5$$. So we can rewrite((x**2+8*x)/(x+5))+((15)/(x+5))as $$\frac{\left(x+3\right) \left(x+5\right)}{x+5}$$
Are there any ways to simplify $$\frac{\left(x+3\right) \left(x+5\right)}{x+5}$$?
What is the greatest common factor shared by the numerator and denominator in $$\frac{\left(x+3\right) \left(x+5\right)}{x+5}$$?
As the final step, we cancel out $$x+5$$ on both numerator and denominator, what is the simplified form of $$\frac{\left(x+3\right) \left(x+5\right)}{x+5}$$?
Note that the expression $$\frac{x^2+8x}{x+5}+\frac{15}{x+5}$$ and $$x+3$$ are different because the domain of ((x**2+8*x)/(x+5))+((15)/(x+5))) does not include $$x=-5$$. The domain of $$x+3$$ does not exclude $$x=-5$$. Strictly $$\operatorname{speaking}\left(\frac{x^2+8x}{x+5}\right)+\frac{15}{x+5}$$ equals $$x+3$$ excluding the domain $$x=-5$$.
Do all the terms in the expression have common denominator?
Yes, $$\frac{5x^2-7x+3}{x^2-3x-18}$$ and $$\frac{4x^2+x-9}{x^2-3x-18}$$ shared the same common denominator of $$x^2-3x-18$$.
Since all of fractions in the expression have common denominator, we can subtract the numerators and place the difference over the common denominator.
What is the difference of numerators for $$\frac{5x^2-7x+3}{x^2-3x-18}-\frac{4x^2+x-9}{x^2-3x-18}$$?
We can factor the difference of numerator we yield from step above to check if we can simplify the expression.
Factor $$x^2-8x+12$$.
In order to factor $$x^2-8x+12$$, you can use reverse foiling, completing square or quadratic formula. In here we can use reverse-foiling. $$\left(x-a\right) \left(x-b\right)=x^2-\left(a+b\right) x+ab$$. In this case, we get $$a b=12$$ and $$-\left(a+b\right)=-8$$. Assume both a and $$b$$ are integers, $$a=2$$ and $$b=6$$ is only one possible combination that satisfies $$a b=12$$ and $$-\left(a+b\right)=-8$$. So you can factor $$x^2-8x+12$$ as ?
From above steps, we get the difference of numerator is $$\left(x-2\right) \left(x-6\right)$$ and the denominator is $$x^2-3x-18$$. So we can rewrite $$\frac{5x^2-7x+3}{x^2-3x-18}-\frac{4x^2+x-9}{x^2-3x-18}$$ as $$\frac{\left(x-2\right) \left(x-6\right)}{x^2-3x-18}$$
Are there any ways to simplify $$\frac{\left(x-2\right) \left(x-6\right)}{x^2-3x-18}$$?
Factor $$x^2-3x-18$$.
Put back together, we can rewrite $$\frac{5x^2-7x+3}{x^2-3x-18}-\frac{4x^2+x-9}{x^2-3x-18}$$ as $$\frac{\left(x-2\right) \left(x-6\right)}{\left(x+3\right) \left(x-6\right)}$$. What is the greatest common factor shared by the numerator and denominator in $$\frac{\left(x-2\right) \left(x-6\right)}{\left(x+3\right) \left(x-6\right)}$$?
As the final step, we cancel out $$x-6$$ on both numerator and denominator, what is the simplified form of $$\frac{\left(x-2\right) \left(x-6\right)}{\left(x+3\right) \left(x-6\right)}$$?
Note that the expression $$\frac{5x^2-7x+3}{x^2-3x-18}-\frac{4x^2+x-9}{x^2-3x-18}$$ and $$\frac{x-2}{x+3}$$ are different because the domain of $$\frac{5x^2-7x+3}{x^2-3x-18}-\frac{4x^2+x-9}{x^2-3x-18}$$ does not include $$x=-3$$ and $$x=6$$. The domain of $$\frac{x-2}{x+3}$$ does not exclude $$x=6$$.
Do all the terms in the expression have common denominator?
Yes, $$\frac{4x^2-11x+8}{x^2-3x+2}$$ and $$\frac{3x^2+x-3}{x^2-3x+2}$$ shared the same common denominator of $$x^2-3x+2$$

We can factor the difference of numerator we yield from step above to check if we can simplify the expression.
Factor $$x^2-12x+11$$.
From above steps, we get the difference of numerator is $$\left(x-11\right) \left(x-1\right)$$ and the denominator is $$x^2-3x+2$$. So we can rewrite $$\frac{4x^2-11x+8}{x^2-3x+2}-\frac{3x^2+x-3}{x^2-3x+2}$$ as $$\frac{\left(x-11\right) \left(x-1\right)}{x^2-3x+2}$$
Are there any ways to simplify $$\frac{\left(x-11\right) \left(x-1\right)}{x^2-3x+2}$$?

As the final step, we cancel out $$x-1$$ on both numerator and denominator, what is the simplified form of ((x-11)*(x-1))/((x-1)*(x-2)))?

Factor $$x^2-12x+27$$.
From above steps, we get the difference of numerator is $$\left(x-3\right) \left(x-9\right)$$ and the denominator is $$x^2-81$$. So we can rewrite $$\frac{6x^2-x+20}{x^2-81}-\frac{5x^2+11x-7}{x^2-81}$$ as $$\frac{\left(x-3\right) \left(x-9\right)}{x^2-81}$$

Note that the $$\operatorname{expression}\left(\frac{6x^2-x+20}{x^2-81}\right)-\frac{5x^2+11x-7}{x^2-81}$$ and $$\frac{x-3}{x+9}$$ are different because the domain of $$\frac{6x^2-x+20}{x^2-81}-\frac{5x^2+11x-7}{x^2-81}$$ does not include $$x=9$$. The domain of $$\frac{x-3}{x+9}$$ does not exclude $$x=9$$.

Note that the expression ((y**2-5*y)/(y**2-4))-((6*y-6)/(4-y**2))and $$\frac{y+3}{y+2}$$ are different because the domain of $$\frac{y^2-5y}{y^2-4}-\frac{6y-6}{4-y^2}$$ does not include $$x=2$$ and the domain of $$\frac{y+3}{y+2}$$ does not exclude $$x=2$$.

Finding the product of two matrices is only possible when the inner dimensions are the same, meaning that the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix. If A is an m×r matrix and B is an r×n matrix, then the product matrix AB is an m×n matrix. For example, the product AB is possible because the number of columns in A is the same as the number of rows in B. If the inner dimensions do not match, the product is not defined.\n##figure1.gif##
For a matrix $$AB=C$$, we can obtain entry $$c_{i,j}$$ by multipying the entries in row i of A by column of j in B and adding them. For example, given matrices A and B, where the dimensions of A are 2x3 and the dimensions of B are 3x3, the product of AB will be a 2x3 matrix.\n$$A=/\begin{bmatrix} a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & a_{1,3} \\ a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & a_{2,3} \end{bmatrix}$$ and $$B=\begin{bmatrix} b_{1,1} & b_{1,2} & b_{1,3} \\ b_{2,1} & b_{2,2} & b_{2,3} \\ b_{3,1} & b_{3,2} & b_{3,3} \end{bmatrix}$$.\nTo obtain $$c_{1,1}$$ we multiply the first row of A with the first column of B and add. Thus, $$c_{1,1}=a_{1,1} b_{1,1}+a_{1,2} b_{2,1}+a_{1,3} b_{3,1}$$.

What is $$\sqrt{2df}$$?
The df being greater than $$90$$ approximates a certain type of distribution which is symmetric.
When df < $$90$$, the distribution is always skewed to the right.
Think about what this means for symmetry.
If a distribution is skewed to the right, is it symmetrical or nonsymmetrical?
When the df is greater than $$90$$, the curve is approximately symmetric. This would indicate the normal distribution.
The distribution of the curve is typically skewed to the right. Based on this, think about where μ would be.
Where would this indicate that μ is located?
The more skewed to the right the graph is, the lower the df value is.
Since this graph is quite skewed the the right, the lowest df possible would be the answer.

The general form is $$0<|x-a|<\delta$$, where a is what $$x$$ approaches.

For negative infinite limits, we are trying to prove that the function of the limit is less than -M
This problem can be solved the same way we solved for delta in precise definition of limits problems
Since the engineer is trying to cut a square of area $$144{cm}^2$$ equal side lengths which we can denote $$x$$, then we can get the limit $$\lim_{x\to12} x^2=144$$. The error tolerance is the same as the epsilon in a precise definition problem.
Now we need to translate our information into the general form of theconditional statement portion of the precise defintion of a limit. The general form is if $$|x-a|<\delta$$, then $$|f{\left(x\right)}-L|<\epsilon$$ for the limit $$\lim_{x\toa} f(x)=L)$$.
To solve, we need to first graph the function, $$x^2$$
Here, we need to find how close to $$12$$ must $$x$$ be, if $$y$$ is within epsilon $$=$$ $$8$$ units of $$144$$ on the graph. We can find this by drawing boundary lines on the graph that fulfill these conditions and making delta the distance from $$x=12$$ to the closer of the $$2$$ $$x-boundary$$ lines.
Error tolerance is similar to the idea of how close $$x$$ must to a number if $$y$$ is epsilon away from another number.
The corresponding accuracy is similar to how close our estimate of delta for $$x$$ if $$y$$ is epsilon units from another number.
a is what $$x$$, the side lengths, are approaching.
L is the maximum value the limit if approaching, which is similar to the maximum area.
To solve, we need to look at the limit of our function and see what operation must be done to get $$x$$ to have a power and coefficient of $$1$$ only and apply the same operations to epsilon.
Here, we need to represent the distance between $$x$$ and what $$x$$ approaches (in this case 0), such that $$x$$ is greater than and does not equal what it approaches.
The main issue is that no matter what L or $$x$$ is, the statement will not hold true. Try plugging in values for L and $$x$$ to check.
Remember that epsilon in a ε-δ defintion is used to quantify the distance between the function and what the limit is equal to.
The distance between the function and what it is equal to, L in this case, cannot be negative, thus what must epsilon be?
Remember tha delta in a ε-δ defintion must be greater than the distance between the variable(x in this case) and what the variable is going to (c in this case).
Since delta must be greater than the distance between $$t$$ and $$b$$, then delta must be positive
We need to represent the distance between $$x$$ and c, such that $$x$$ is greater than and does not equal c.
For the limit, the function must be closer to epislon than L. This step is asking how we can represent this mathematically using h(x) and L.
Remember that epsilon in a ε-δ defintion is used to quantify the distance between the function and what the limit is equal to.
The distance between the function and what it is equal to, A in this case, cannot be negative, thus what must epsilon be?
Remember tha delta in a ε-δ defintion must be greater than the distance between the variable(x in this case) and what the variable is going to (a in this case).
Since delta must be greater than the distance between $$t$$ and $$b$$, then delta must be positive
We need to represent the distance between $$x$$ and a, such that $$x$$ is greater than and does not equal a.
For the limit, the function must be closer to epislon than A. This step is asking how we can represent this mathematically using w(x) and A.
The statement tell us that if $$x$$ is closer than delta to $$2$$ and $$x$$ is not equal to $$2$$, then f(x) is closer to than $$1$$ to $$2$$.
In essence, we are asked to find how close to $$2$$ must $$x$$ be, if $$y$$ is within $$1$$ unit of $$2$$ on the graph. We can find this by drawing boundary lines on the graph that fulfill these conditions and making delta the distance from $$x=2$$ to the closer of the two $$x-boundary$$ lines.

In essence, we are asked to find how close to $$3$$ must $$x$$ be, if $$y$$ is within $$1$$ unit of $$-1$$ on the graph. We can find this by drawing boundary lines on the graph that fulfill these conditions and making delta the distance from $$x=3$$ to the closer of the $$2$$ $$x-boundary$$ lines.

Based on the precise definition of a limit, then if we use the information from the limit we get If $$0<|x-3|<\delta$$, then $$|f{\left(x\right)}-2|<\epsilon$$.
The precise definition of a limit tells us that if $$x$$ is closer than delta to $$3$$ and $$x$$ is not equal to $$3$$, then f(x) is closer to than epsilon to $$2$$.

The first step is to rewrite the function and simplify it so we can apply the power rule: $$\int_{1}^{4} \sqrt{t} \left(1+t\right) \,dt=\int_{1}^{4} t^{\frac{1}{2}} \left(1+t\right) \,dt$$
Contribute $$t^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ into the term inside parenthesis to obtain $$\int_{1}^{4} t^{\frac{1}{2}}+t^{\frac{3}{2}} \,dt$$

We will start by converting the word problem into the mathematical expession. According to the Net change theorem, the rate of change of surface of a cube formula will be integrated with the boundaries go from $$x=s$$ to $$x=2s$$.
With the information given in hint $$1$$, how can we express the integral?
The Net Change Theorem giving the integral for determining change in a function F(x) when $$x$$ changes from a to $$b$$ is stated as $$F(b)-F(a)=\int_{a}^{b} \frac{d}{\operatorname{dx}\left(F\left(x\right)\right)} \,dx$$
$$\frac{d}{dx} F\left(x\right)=\frac{d}{dx} 6x^2=12x$$
$$\int_{s}^{2s} 12x \,dx=\frac{12x^2}{2}$$ with $$x$$ running from $$x=s$$ to $$x=2s$$
$$\frac{12{\left(2s\right)}^2}{2}-\frac{12s^2}{2}=18s^2$$

With the information given in hint $$1$$, how can we express the integral?
The surface of a cube formula originally is $$8\pi x$$ with $$x$$ is a radius of the sphere. The term $$8\pi$$ can be treated as a constant and moved out of the integral.
The Net Change Theorem giving the integral for determining change in a function F(x) when $$x$$ changes from a to $$b$$ is stated as $$F(b)-F(a)=\int_{a}^{b} \frac{d}{dx} F\left(x\right) \,dx$$
$$\frac{d}{dx} F\left(x\right)=\frac{d}{dx} 4\pi r^2=8\pi x$$
$$8*pi*\int_{R}^{2R} x \,dx=\frac{8\pi x^2}{2}$$ with $$x$$ running from $$x=R$$ to $$x=2R$$

Seperate and conpute the integral of each term $$\int_{0}^{3} 300 \,dt-\int_{0}^{3} 150t \,dt$$
$$300\times3-150\frac{3^2}{2}=225$$
We can begin by setting the upper and the lower boundaries of the definite integral as the function v(t) starts from $$t=0$$ and $$t=3$$

We obtain $$\frac{3}{2} t^2-5t$$ with $$t=0$$ as the lower boundary and $$t=3$$ as the upper boundary.
(3/2)*(3**2)-5*3)-((3/2)*(0**2)-5*0)=-3/2
$$v(t)=v_0+g t$$ where g is the acceleration due to gravity and $$t$$ is the time of function.
$$v(t)=40+\left(-9.8\right) t=40-9.8t$$
$$h(t)=h-v_0 t+\frac{1}{2} g t^2=1.5+40t+\frac{1}{2} \left(-9.8t^2\right)=1.5+40t-4.9t^2$$
The total distance traveled includes both the positive and the negative values. Therefore, we must integrate the absolute value of the velocity function to find the total distance traveled. To continue with the example, use two integrals to find the total distance. First, find the $$t-intercept$$ of the function, since that is where the division of the interval occurs. Set the equation equal to zero and solve for $$t$$. Thus,
What is the $$t-intercept$$ of this function?
The two subintervals are $$[0,\frac{5}{3}]$$ and $$[\frac{5}{3},3]$$. To find the total distance traveled, integrate the absolute value of the function. Since the function is negative over the interval $$[0,\frac{5}{3}]$$ and positive over $$[\frac{5}{3},3]$$, we obtain /int{-(3*t)-5),0,5/3,t}+/int{(3*t)-5,5/3,3,t}
Power rules for integrals gives us $$\left(-\frac{3t^2}{2}\right)+5t$$ with $$t=$$ $$0$$ as a lower boundary and $$t=\frac{5}{3}$$ as an upper boundary added to $$\left(-\frac{3t^2}{2}\right)+5t$$ with $$t=$$ $$\frac{5}{3}$$ as a lower boundary and $$t=3$$ as an upper boundary.
-3*((5/3)**2)/2+5*(5/3)+27/2-15-(-3*((5/3)**2)/2)-25/3)=41/6
So the total distance traveled is $$\frac{41}{6}$$ $$m$$.

Since $$\frac{2\times500}{3}=\frac{1000}{3}$$, we have verified the formula for even functions in this particular example.
We can see the symmetry about the origin by the positive area above the x-axis over [-pi,0] and the negative area below the -axis over [0,pi].

First, you should look at the box plot and understand the what the min and max values would indicate in the context of your example.
Secondly, you must look for an example that makes sense in the context. i.e. a maximum value of $$150$$ would make it impossible for it to indicate hours of sleep per day.
First, find what percentage of data values fall in each interval that is clear. $$38-41$$ has 25%, and so does $$41-64$$ and $$31-38$$. This means that less than 25% is between $$31-35$$, making it the smallest interval.
First, you must find the skew of each box plot. Having more data on the left side means it is skewed right. More data on right side means skewed left.
In box plots, we are only given $$5$$ key numbers, so we do not know the amount of people at each point on the graph. This means that we do not know the specific amount of people that have to more than $$8$$ foreign countries.
First, find the medians: China doesn't have a median while Germany has one at $$8$$ and the United States at $$2$$. $$8$$ > $$2$$ so it is most likely that Germany travels more, but this dataset is too small for any conclusive claims.
First, you must look at where the first, second, and third quartiles are. The first is at $$0$$, the second at $$20$$, and the third slightly before $$100$$.
Secondly, you must understand that to be close in a box plot means that the data in those quarties is similar as there is not much variation. If they are far apart, there is more variation.
First, you need to determine the shape of each box plot. All through tend to have more greater values which means they are all skewed right.
Secondly, you must understand what a right skew means in context. Here, it shows that the ages of the top 50% of buyers are more variable than the ages of the lower 50%.
Think about what properties of a box plot is affected by outliers. The box plot with the longest whisker will be most likely to have an outlier (BMW3).
First, you should look for the medians of each of the box plots and compare them in relation to each other. From this, we can see that the median of $$7$$ > median of $$5$$ > median of $$3$$.
First, to pinpoint the smallest quarter, split the box plot into the $$4$$ quarters based on the quartiles and end points and find the smallest one in length (2nd).
To find the spread of the 2nd quarter, calculate the difference between the first quartile and the median which is $$3$$.
First, to pinpoint the largest quarter, split the box plot into the $$4$$ quarters based on the quartiles and end points and find the largest one in length (3rd).
To find the spread of the 3rd quarter, calculate the difference between the median and the third quartile which is $$14$$.
To calculate IQR, you must take the 3rd quartile and subtract eh 1st quartile. This results in $$55$$ - $$38$$ $$=$$ $$17$$
First look at where the intervals lie on the box plot. Here, these intervals are within a quarter so we cannot tell exactly where the data in the quarter is concentrated.

We must set $$x$$ equal to $$0$$ and then solve for f(x). When we do this, we get $$f(x)=\frac{5}{4}$$. Thus, our y-intercept is $$(0,\frac{5}{4})$$
Now, we must set f(x) equal to $$0$$ and solve for $$x$$. $$\frac{x+5}{x^2+4}=0$$. This is $$0$$ when the numerator is equal to $$0$$. $$x+5=0$$. This means that the x-intercept is $$(-5,0)$$.
We must set $$x$$ equal to $$0$$ and then solve for f(x). $$f(x)=\frac{0}{0}$$. There is no y-intercept.
We must now set $$f(x)=0$$ and solve for $$x$$. Since the denominator becomes undefined, there is no x-intercept.
We must now set $$x$$ equal to $$0$$ and then solve for f(x). This leaves us with $$\frac{7}{30}$$.
We must now set f(x) equal to $$0$$ and then solve for $$x$$. $$x^2+8x+7=0$$. $$\left(x+7\right) \left(x+1\right)=0$$. This means that $$x=-7$$ and $$-1$$.
We must set $$x$$ equal to $$0$$ and solve for f(x) to find the y-intercept. This leavees us with $$\frac{6}{24}$$, or $$\frac{1}{4}$$.
Now, we must set f(x) equal to $$0$$ and solve $$x$$. There are no x-intercepts.
We must setet $$x$$ equal to $$0$$ and solve for f(x) in order to find the y-intercept. This leaves us with $$\frac{-94}{12}$$.

Let μ1, μ2, μ3, μ4 be the population means of the sororities. Remember that the null hypothesis claims that the sorority groups are from the same normal distribution.

The null and alternative hypotheses are the following, respectively: $$H_0$$: μ1 $$=$$ μ2 $$=$$ μ3 $$=$$ μ4 and $$H_a$$: Not all of the means μ1, μ2, μ3, μ4 are equal.

Find the LCD.
What is the LCD?
Multiply each expression by the appropriate form of $$1$$ to obtain xy as the denominator for each fraction.
What is the first fraction?
What is the second fraction?
Now that the expressions have the same denominator, we simply add the numerators to find the sum.
What is the final fraction?
The first step is to find the least common denominator of two rational expressions.
What is the least common denominator?
Since we do not know the value of a, the least common multiple of the denominators is their product. So, the LCD is $$\left(a+1\right) \left(a-3\right)$$.
Now we need to multiply both expressions by a factor equal to $$1$$ that makes the denominators equal to the LCD. Starting with the first expression, we can multiply $$\frac{4}{a+1}$$ by a factor to make the denominator $$\left(a+1\right) \left(a-3\right)$$.
The denominator of $$\frac{4}{a+1}$$ multiplied by $$a+3$$ equals $$\left(a+1\right) \left(a+3\right)$$. So, we need to multiply $$\frac{4}{a+1}$$ by $$\frac{a+3}{a+3}$$.
What is $$\frac{4}{a+1} \frac{a-3}{a-3}$$?
What is $$4\left(a-3\right)$$?
When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. For the numerators, we can distribute the $$4$$ into the $$a+3$$ by adding $$4a$$ andadding it to $$4\left(-3\right)$$. The numerator then becomes 4a-12. After multiplying the denominators, we can leave the denominator as $$\left(a+1\right) \left(a-3\right)$$ since it is in its factored form. So, the new expression becomes $$\frac{4a-12}{\left(a+1\right) \left(a-3\right)}$$.
Next, we need to multiply the second expression by a fraction to make the denominator equal to the LCD. Because the denominator of $$\frac{5}{a-3}$$ needs to by multiplied by $$a+1$$ to become $$\left(a+1\right) \left(a-3\right)$$, we need to $$\frac{5}{a-3}$$ by $$\frac{a+1}{a+1}$$.
What is $$\frac{5}{a-3} \frac{a+1}{a+1}$$?
We distribute the $$5$$ into $$a+1$$ to get $$5a+4$$. Then, we leave the denominator in its factored form.
Because the expressions now have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the sum of the two expressions. We'll leave the denominator as it is, but combine the numerator's like terms.
What is $$5a+4a$$?
What is $$-12+5$$?
Now we have our final expression: $$\frac{9a-7}{\left(a+1\right) \left(a-3\right)}$$.
The first step is to find the least common denominator of two rational expressions.
What is the least common denominator?
Since we do not know the value of $$y$$, the least common multiple of the denominators is their product. So, the LCD is $$\left(y-2\right) \left(y+1\right)$$.
Now we need to multiply both expressions by a factor equal to $$1$$ that makes the denominators equal to the LCD. Starting with the first expression, we can multiply $$\frac{y+3}{y+1}$$ by a factor to make the denominator $$\left(y-2\right) \left(y+1\right)$$.
The denominator of $$\frac{y+3}{y-2}$$ multiplied by $$y+1$$ equals $$\left(y-2\right) \left(y+1\right)$$. So, we need to multiply $$\frac{y+3}{y+1}$$ by $$\left(y+1\right) \left(y+1\right)$$.
What is $$\frac{y+3}{y-2} \left(y+1\right) \left(y+1\right)$$?
$$\left(y+3\right) \left(y+1\right)$$
When multiplying polynomials, we need to use FOIL.
First, multiply the first value in each polynomial: $$y y=y^2$$. Next, multiply the outside values: $$1y=y$$. Then, multiply the inside values: $$3y=3y$$. Lastly, multiply the last values: $$3\times1=3$$. Finally, combine like terms: $$y+3y=4y$$. So, the expression reads $$y^2+4y+3$$.
Next, we need to multiply the second expression by a fraction to make the denominator equal to the LCD. Because the denominator of $$\frac{y-3}{y+1}$$ needs to by multiplied by $$y-2$$ to become $$\left(y-2\right) \left(y+1\right)$$, we need to $$\frac{y-3}{y+1}$$ by $$(y-2)(y-2)$$.
What is $$\frac{y+3}{y-2} \frac{y+1}{y+1}$$?
When multiplying polynomials, we need to use FOIL.
First, multiply the first value in each polynomial: $$y y=y^2$$. Next, multiply the outside values: $$1y=y$$. Then, multiply the inside values: $$3y=3y$$. Lastly, multiply the last values: $$3\times1=3$$. Finally, combine like terms: $$y+3y=4y$$. So, the expression reads $$y^2+4y+3$$.
Because the expressions now have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the sum of the two expressions. We'll leave the denominator as it is, but combine the numerator's like terms.
What is $$y^2+4y+3-y^2-5y+6$$?
Combine the like terms: $$y^2-y^2=0;$$ $$4y+5y=9y;$$ $$3-6=-3$$.
Now we have our final expression: $$\frac{2y^2-y+9}{\left(y-2\right) \left(y+1\right)}$$.
Factoring is the process to split a product into a group of factors (a multiplication of simpler expressions).
Not all terms can be factored. Factor the terms that can be split further.
In this case, we can factor all the factors.
What does $$2x^2+x-6$$ factor into?
What does $$x^2-1$$ factor into?
What does $$x^2-4$$ factor into?
What does $$x^2+2x+1$$ factor into?
Now that you have factored all possible terms, if you see the same term in the numerator and the denominator of the product, you can cancel it out.
In this case, we can cancel out $$x+1$$ and $$x+2$$.
After canceling out terms, your final answer will remain in product form. What is the answer?
The first step is to find the least common denominator of two rational expressions.
What is the least common denominator?
Since we do not know the value of $$z$$, the least common multiple of the denominators is their product. So, the LCD is $$\left(z-2\right) \left(z+1\right)$$.
Now we need to multiply both expressions by a factor equal to $$1$$ that makes the denominators equal to the LCD. Starting with the first expression, we can multiply $$\frac{3z}{z+1}$$ by a factor to make the denominator $$\left(z-2\right) \left(z+1\right)$$.
The denominator of $$\frac{3z}{z-2}$$ multiplied by $$z+1$$ equals $$\left(z-2\right) \left(z+1\right)$$. So, we need to multiply $$\frac{3z}{y+1}$$ by $$\frac{z-2}{z-2}$$.
What is $$\frac{3z}{z+1} \frac{z-2}{z-2}$$?
What is $$3z \left(z-2\right)$$
We need to distribute the $$3z$$ into the $$(z-2)$$: $$3z z=3z^2$$ and $$3z \left(-2\right)=-6z$$. So, the numerator is $$\frac{3z^2}{\left(z-2\right) \left(z+1\right)}$$. We can leave the denominator in its factored form.
Next, we need to multiply the second expression by a fraction to make the denominator equal to the LCD. Because the denominator of $$\frac{2z+5}{z+1}$$ needs to by multiplied by $$(z-2)$$ to become $$\left(z-2\right) \left(z+1\right)$$, we need to $$\frac{2z+5}{z+1}$$ by $$\frac{z-2}{z-2}$$.
What is $$\frac{2z+5}{z-2} \frac{z+1}{z+1}$$?
When multiplying polynomials, we need to use FOIL.
First, multiply the first value in each polynomial: $$2z z=2z^2$$. Next, multiply the outside values: $$2z\times1=2z$$. Then, multiply the inside values: $$5z=5z$$. Lastly, multiply the last values: $$5\times1=5$$. Finally, combine like terms: $$2z+5z=7z$$. So, the expression reads $$2z^2+7z+5$$.
Because the expressions now have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the difference of the two expressions. We'll leave the denominator as it is, but combine the numerator's like terms.
What is $$3z^2-6z-2z^2+7z+5$$?
Combine the like terms: $$3z^2-2z^2=z^2$$ $$-6z-7z=-13z;$$ $$-6$$ stays the same.
Now we have our final expression: $$\frac{z^2-13z-6}{\left(z-2\right) \left(z+1\right)}$$.
The first step is to find the least common denominator of two rational expressions.
What is the least common denominator?
Since we do not know the value of $$x$$ or $$y$$, the least common multiple of the denominators is their product. So, the LCD is $$\left(x+1\right) \left(y+1\right)$$.
Now we need to multiply both expressions by a factor equal to $$1$$ that makes the denominators equal to the LCD. Starting with the first expression, we can multiply $$\frac{x}{x+1}$$ by a factor to make the denominator $$\left(x+1\right) \left(y+1\right)$$.
The denominator of $$\frac{x}{x+1}$$ multiplied by $$y+1$$ equals $$\left(x+1\right) \left(y+1\right)$$. So, we need to multiply $$\frac{x}{x+1}$$ by $$\frac{y+1}{y+1}$$.
What is $$\frac{x}{x+1} \frac{y+1}{y+1}$$?
We can keep the denominator as it is, but distribute the $$x$$ into $$y+1$$: $$xy+x$$.
Next, we need to multiply the second expression by a fraction to make the denominator equal to the LCD. Because the denominator of $$\frac{y}{y+1}$$ needs to by multiplied by $$x+1$$ to become $$\left(z+1\right) \left(y+1\right)$$, we need to $$\frac{y}{y+1}$$ by $$\frac{y+1}{y+1}$$.
What is $$\frac{y}{y+1} \frac{x+1}{x+1}$$?
Distribute the $$y$$ into $$x+1$$: $$x y=xy$$ and $$1y=y$$, so the expression reads $$xy+y$$.
Because the expressions now have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the sum of the two expressions. We'll leave the denominator as it is, but combine the numerator's like terms.
What is $$xy+x+xy+y$$?
Combine the like terms: $$xy+xy=2xy;$$ the $$x$$ and $$y$$ stay the same.
Now we have our final expression: $$\frac{2xy+x+y}{\left(x+1\right) \left(y+1\right)}$$.

We are looking for the number of cherries in the fruit salad and will introduce a variable to relate the number of pieces of each fruit. If we let our variable denote the number of cherries then some work is needed to set up our relationship because the first sentence in the problem deals with blueberries and raspberries. There are twice as many raspberries as blueberries so it is natural to let $$x$$ denote the number of blueberries.
We find that Blueberries can be represented by $$x$$, Rasberries by $$2x$$, Cherries by $$8x$$, and Grapes by $$24x$$

Using the distributive property, we see that subtracting 20% is the same as multiplying by $$(1-0.20)$$: $$22.50-(0.20(22.50))=(1-0.20)(22.50)$$
Multiplying by $$1-0.20=0.80$$ is the same thing as finding $$80$$ percent. Adding 10% is the same as multiplying by $$1+0.1$$: $$18+\operatorname{0.1}\left(18\right)=18\left(1+0.1\right)$$
Multiplying by $$1+0.1=1.10$$ is the same thing as finding $$110$$ percent. Thus, Katie's method is correct.
Margarita first computes 80% of the original price: $$(0.80)22.50=18.00$$
Next, she computes 110% of the new amount: $$(1.10)18.00=19.80$$
Margarita has $$\$20.00$$, thus she can buy the book.

The inverse function theorem is that (f**(-1))'*(x)=1/(f'*(f**-1)*(x)).
To find the inverse of f(x) where $$a=0$$, then we need to first find what value of $$x$$ when we plug it into f(x) will give us a value of $$0$$. In this case, it is when $$x=-1$$, so we know that $$0f^{\left(-1\right)}=-1$$.
Next, to find the derivative of f(x), we can use the power rule. To do this, we can multiply the coefficient of each $$x$$ by its current exponent, and then subtract $$1$$ from the exponent. Remember, constants become $$0$$ when we take the derivative of a function.
Since we already found $$0f^{\left(-1\right)}=-1$$ and the derivative of f(x), then we can plug what we know into the inverse function theorem.

Find the Greatest Common Factor of all three terms in the expression.
What is the greatest factor of all three terms $$7x^3$$, $$21x^2$$, and $$70x$$?
Rewrite the expression by factoring out the greatest common factor.
Given that $$x^2-3x-10$$ is a trinomial, we can try to factor out linear term from the trinomial. Note that not all trinomial is factorable, but in this case, it is factorable.
$$x^2-3x-10$$ is also a quadratic, there are several approaches we can take to factor this quadratic---completing square, Reversing foil, and using quadratic formula.
In this case, we will use reverse foil method and leave the other approaches as exercise on your own.
We know that $$\left(x+b\right) \left(x+a\right)=x^2+a b x+ab$$. In this case, our $$a b$$ is $$-10$$, assume that both a, $$b$$ is integer. Then we get some possible combination for a, $$b$$ --- (1 and -10) OR (-1 and 10) OR (-2 and 5) OR (2 and -5). Which combination will both satisfy $$a b=-10$$ and $$a+b=-3$$. Please enter your answer in the form (x,y) by having $$x$$ less than $$y$$.
Using the answer you get from last step, write out the linear factor form for $$x^2-3x-10$$ in the form $$\left(x-b\right) \left(x+a\right)$$ where a, $$b$$ are positive integers.
As the final step, put together all the factors. $$7x^3-21x^2-70x=$$

We can rewrite $$9y^2+16$$ as $${\left(3y\right)}^2+4^2$$. Note that sum of squares is prime so it is not factorable. Therefore, we can not further factor $$9y^2+16$$.
Since we can not further factor $$9y^2+16$$ and $$3x y$$, $$27x y^3+48x y$$ can factor completely into $$3x y \left(9y^2+16\right)$$

We observe that $$8x^3+27y^3={\left(2x\right)}^3+{\left(3y\right)}^3$$ which is the sum of cubes. We can use the sum of cubes rule to factor the expression. Sum of cube rule $$\operatorname{statesv}\left(a^3\right)+b^3$$ can be factored completely into $$\left(a+b\right) \left(a^2-a b+b^2\right)$$.
By using the sum of cube rule, we can factor $$8x^3+27y^3$$ as?
Since there is no way to further factor $$2x+3y$$ and $${\left(2x\right)}^2-2x 3y+{\left(3y\right)}^2$$, $$24x^3+81y^3$$ can be factored completely into $$3\left(2x+3y\right) \left({\left(2x\right)}^2-2x 3y+{\left(3y\right)}^2\right)$$.

Are there any ways to write $$27q^3$$ into $$a^3$$? If so, what is a?

By using the sum of cube rule, we can factor $$p^3+27q^3$$ as?
Since there is no way to further factor $$p+3q$$ and $$p^2-p 3q+{\left(3q\right)}^2$$, $$2p^3+54q^3$$ can be factored completely into $$2\left(p+3q\right) \left(p^2-p 3q+{\left(3q\right)}^2\right)$$.

$$4x^2+8b x-4a x-8a b=$$ 4*(?)
Next, we will group the terms with similar factor together.
In the expression, $$x^2+2b x-a x-2a b$$, we will group $$-\left(a x\right)$$ and $$-\left(2a b\right)$$ together.
Factor $$-\left(a x\right)-2a b$$:
We will group $$x^2$$ and $$2b x$$ together so that we can factor out the common factor $$x$$. Then we get $$x^2+2b x=x \left(x+2b\right)$$
By putting together the result of factoring by grouping , we yield $$x^2+2b x-a x-2a b=x \left(x+2b\right)-a \left(x+2b\right)$$. What is the greatest common factor in $$x \left(x+2b\right)$$ and $$-a \left(x+2b\right)$$?
$$x \left(x+2b\right)-a \left(x+2b\right)$$ has the common factor $$x+2b$$, so we can further factor $$x \left(x+2b\right)-a \left(x+2b\right)$$ into (x+2b)*(?). what is (?)?
Based on the above steps, we get $$4x^2+8b x-4a x-8a b=4\left(x \left(x+2b\right)-a \left(x+2b\right)\right)=4\left(x+2b\right) \left(x-a\right)$$
Alternatively, you can also group (-a*x with x**2), (2*b*x with -2*a*b) then do factoring by group. You should yield the same final answer. You can try it as exercise.

We will group $$b x$$ and $$-\left(2b c\right)$$ together, so we can factor out the common factor of $$b$$. $$b x-2b c=b \left(x-2c\right)$$
Based on the above steps, we yield $$x^2-2x c+b x-2b c=x \left(x-2c\right)+b \left(x-2c\right)$$. What is the greatest common factor of $$x \left(x-2c\right)$$ and $$b \left(x-2c\right)$$?
$$x \left(x-2c\right)$$ and $$b \left(x-2c\right)$$ has the greatest common factor $$(x-2c)$$, so we can further factor $$x \left(x-2c\right)+b \left(x-2c\right)$$ into (x-2*c)*(?). what is (?)?
Based on the above steps, we get $$6x^2-12x c+6b x-12b c=6\left(x^2-2x c+b x-2b c\right)=6\left(x+b\right) \left(x-2c\right)$$
Alternatively, you can also group (x**2 with b*x), (-2*x*c with -2*b*c) then do factoring by grouping. You should yield the same final answer. You can try it as exercise.

Next, we will group the terms with similar factor together.
In the expression $$8x^2+12x y-2x-3y$$, we will group $$8x^2$$ and $$12x y$$ together.
Factor $$8x^2+12x y$$.
We will group $$-2x$$ with $$-3y$$ together and factor out $$-1$$. Then we get $$\left(-2x-3y\right)=-1\left(2x+3y\right)$$.
Put together the result of factoring by grouping , we yield $$8x^2+12x y-2x-3y=4x \left(2x+3y\right)-1\left(2x+3y\right)$$. What is the greatest common factor of $$4x \left(2x+3y\right)$$ and $$-1\left(2x+3y\right)$$?
$$4x \left(2x+3y\right)$$ and $$-1\left(2x+3y\right)$$ has the greatest common factor of $$2x+3y$$, so we can further factor $$4x \left(2x+3y\right)-1\left(2x+3y\right)$$ into (2*x+3*y)*(?). what is ?
Based on the above steps, we get $$16x^2+24x y-4x-6y=2\left(8x^2+12x y-2x-3y\right)=2\left(2x+3y\right) \left(4x-1\right)$$
Alternatively, you can also group (8*x**2 with -2*x), (12*x*y with -3*y) then do factoring by grouping. You should yield the same final answer. You can try it as exercise.

The value inside the parenthesis of the cos refers to an angle which also corresponds to a point on the unit circle.
The angle $$\frac{4\pi}{3}$$ corresponds to the point $$(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right),\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right))$$ on the unit circle.
Letting $$x$$ be an angle, sinx $$=$$ $$y$$, cosx $$=$$ $$x$$, and tanx $$=$$ $$\frac{y}{x}$$.
Based on the above information, what is the value of cos $$x$$ at the angle $$\frac{4\pi}{3}$$.
The value inside the parenthesis of the tan refers to an angle which also corresponds to a point on the unit circle.
The angle $$\frac{19\pi}{4}$$ corresponds to more than $$2$$ revolutions around the unit circle and is equal to $$2\pi+2\pi+\frac{3\pi}{4}$$, thus we can continue to subtract by $$2\pi$$ or $$1$$ rotation until we get an angle between $$0$$ and $$2\pi$$ to find the corresponding value on the unit circle.
We know that the angle $$\frac{3\pi}{4}$$ corresponds to the point $$(\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right),\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$$ on the unit circle.
Letting $$x$$ be an angle, sinx $$=$$ $$y$$, cosx $$=$$ $$x$$, and tanx $$=$$ $$\frac{y}{x}$$.
Based on the above information, what is the value of tanx at the angle $$\frac{19\pi}{4}$$.
The value inside the parenthesis of the sin refers to an angle which also corresponds to a point on the unit circle.
The angle $$\frac{\left(-3\pi\right)}{4}$$ corresponds to a revolution in the negative direction, thus we need to add $$2\pi$$ to get the angle $$\frac{5\pi}{4}$$ which corresponds to the point $$(\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right),\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right))$$ on the unit circle.
Letting $$x$$ be an angle, sinx $$=$$ $$y$$, cosx $$=$$ $$x$$, and tanx $$=$$ $$\frac{y}{x}$$.
Based on the above information, what is the value of sinx at the angle $$\frac{\left(-3\pi\right)}{4}$$.
The value inside the parenthesis of the sin refers to an angle which also corresponds to a point on the unit circle.
The angle $$\frac{\pi}{6}$$ corresponds to the point $$(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\frac{1}{2})$$ on the unit circle.
Letting $$x$$ be an angle, cscx $$=$$ $$\frac{1}{y}$$, secx $$=$$ $$\frac{1}{x}$$, and cotx $$=$$ $$\frac{x}{y}$$.
Based on the above information, what is the value of secx at the angle $$\frac{\pi}{6}$$.
The value inside the parenthesis of the sin refers to an angle which also corresponds to a point on the unit circle, but in this case does not.
Since $$\frac{\pi}{12}$$ is not on the common uniform circle, we can use the replacement angles $$\frac{\pi}{3}$$ and $$\frac{\pi}{4}$$. (I.e. $$\frac{\pi}{12}$$ $$=$$ pi/3-pi/4)
The subtraction formula for sinx is sin $$(A-B)=sinA CosB-cosA sinB$$.
Calculate $$sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)-cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$$
The replacement angles $$\frac{\pi}{3}$$ and $$\frac{\pi}{4}$$ are on the common unit circle and sinx $$=$$ the $$y$$ value while cosx $$=$$ the $$x$$ value of the corresponding point on the unit circle.
The value inside the parenthesis of the cos refers to an angle which can also correspond to a point on the unit circle, but in this case does not.
Since $$\frac{5\pi}{12}$$ is not a common angle on the unit circle, we need to use the half angle formula. The half angle formula is $$cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$ $$=$$ $$\pm \sqrt{\frac{1+cosx}{2}}$$. Note that if $$\frac{x}{2}$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{5\pi}{12}$$, then $$x=\frac{5\pi}{6}$$.
What does $$cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)$$ correspond to on the unit circle?
Calculate $$\pm \sqrt{\frac{1+\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{2}}$$
Remember that $$\frac{5\pi}{12}$$ is less than $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$, so it is in quadrant $$1$$, thus $$cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)$$ is positive.

What is the function in which $$x-1$$ is inserted to get its cube root?
The other function is what you put into the previous function to get the given function.

Remember that $$f+g$$ is the same as $$\left(f+g\right) x$$. All we have to do is add the two functions.
What is $$x^2+2x+6x-x^2$$?
Remember that f-g is the same as $$(f-g)(x)$$. All we have to do is subtract the two functions.
What is $$x^2+2x-6x-x^2$$?
Remember that fg is the same as (fg)(x). All we have to do is use foil to multiply the two functions.
What is $$\left(x^2+2x\right) \left(6x-x^2\right)$$?
After multiplying the products, there are no like terms to combine, so we will be left with $$-\left(x^4\right)-2x^3+6x+12x$$.
Remember that $$\frac{f}{g}$$ is the same as $$\frac{f}{g} x$$. All we have to do divide the two functions.
After dividing the two expressions, there is nothing to simplify so we will be left with $$\frac{x^2+2x}{6-x^2}$$.
Remember that $$f+g$$ is the same as $$\left(f+g\right) x$$. All we have to do is add the two functions.
There are no like terms to combine, so the final answer $$is3 x^2+x+5$$.
Remember that f-g is the same as $$(f-g)(x)$$. All we have to do is subtract the two functions.

What is $$5\left(-3x^2+x\right)$$?
Remember that $$\frac{f}{g}$$ is the same as $$\frac{f}{g} x$$. All we have to do is divide the two functions.
After dividing the terms, there is nothing to simplify so we will be left with $$\frac{\left(-3x^2+x\right)}{5}$$.
Remember that $$f+g$$ is the same as $$\left(f+g\right) x$$. All we have to do is add the two functions.
What is $$2x^2+2x+12x$$?
Remember that f-g is the same as $$(f-g)(x)$$. All we have to do is subtract the two functions.
What is $$2x^2+4x-12x$$?
Remember that fg is the same as $$f g x$$. All we have to do is use foil to multiply the two functions.
What is $$\left(2x^2+4x\right) 12x$$?
After multiplying the products, there are no like terms to combine, so we will be left with $$24x^3+48x^2$$.
Remember that $$\frac{f}{g}$$ is the same as $$\frac{f}{g} x$$. All we have to do is divide the two functions.
Let's start by putting the equation in fractional form, $$\frac{2x^2+4x}{12x}$$,
Now, we can factor out $$2x$$ from the numerator and denominator: $$\frac{2x\left(x+2\right)}{2x\times6}$$.
The $$2x$$ in the numerator and denominatory cancel each other out, so we are left with $$\frac{x+2}{6}$$.
Remember that $$f+g$$ is the same as $$\left(f+g\right) x$$. All we have to do is add the two functions.
First, because these functions are fractions, we need to find a common denominator. Our common denominator is the product of the two existing denominators: $$(x-4)(6-x)$$.
Now we need to multiply the fractions by a factor of $$1$$ to get them to have the common denominator. (1/(x-4))*((6-x)(6-x))=(6-x)/((x-4)(6-x), and (1/(6-x))*((x-4)(x-4))=(x-4)/((x-4)(6-x). Now, we need to add these new fractions together.
Our last step is to add the numerators. By adding the $$x$$ terms and the constants, $$\frac{x-4+6-x}{\left(x-4\right) \left(6-x\right)}$$ becomes our final solution: $$\frac{2}{\left(x-4\right) \left(6-x\right)}$$.
Remember that f-g is the same as $$(f-g)(x)$$. All we have to do is subtract the two functions.
Again, because these functions are fractions, we need to find a common denominator. Our common denominator is still $$(x-4)(6-x)$$. Just like in the addition step, we need to multiply the fractions by a factor of $$1$$ to get them to have the common denominator. We are left with(6-x)/((x-4)(6-x) and (x-4)/((x-4)(6-x).
Our last step is to add the numerators. By subtracting the $$x$$ terms and the constants, $$\frac{6-x-x-4}{\left(x-4\right) \left(6-x\right)}$$ becomes our final solution: $$\frac{10-2x}{\left(x-4\right) \left(6-x\right)}$$.
Remember that fg is the same as $$f g x$$. All we have to do is use foil to multiply the two functions.
Since we are multiplying fractions, we muliply the numerators together and the denominators together. $$1\times1=1$$, so the numerator stays the same. The denominator becomes $$(x-4)(6-x)$$ which we can leave in this factored form. Our answer is $$\frac{1}{\left(x-4\right) \left(6-x\right)}$$.
Remember that $$\frac{f}{g}$$ is the same as $$\frac{f}{g} x$$. All we have to do is divide the two functions.
Since these functions are fractions, we need to keep, change, and switch to divide them. We keep $$\frac{1}{x-4}$$ the same, change the division to muliplication, and switch $$\frac{1}{6-x}$$ to $$\frac{6-x}{1}$$.
We now multiply the numerators and denominators together. $$1\left(6-x\right)=6-x$$, and $$1\left(x-4\right)=x-4$$. So, the final answer is $$\frac{6-x}{x-4}$$.
What is the function in which $$x^2+7$$ is inserted to get its absolute value?
The other function is what you put into the previous function to get the given function.
What is the second function?
Remember that $$f+g$$ is the same as $$\left(f+g\right) x$$. All we have to do is add the two functions.
There are no like terms to combine, so the answer is just the sum of the two functions.
Remember that f-g is the same as $$(f-g)(x)$$. All we have to do is add the two functions.
There are no like terms to combine, so the answer is just the difference of the two functions.
Remember that fg is the same as $$f g x$$. All we have to do is use foil to multiply the two functions.
There is no way to simplify the product of these functions, so we leave the answer as one function multiplied by the other.
Remember that $$\frac{f}{g}$$ is the same as $$\frac{f}{g} x$$. All we have to do is divide the two functions.
Let's write the quotient of these functions as a fraction: (3x**2)/(sqrt(x-5). Because the bottom of the function is a square root, we need to rationalize the function by getting rid of the square root in the denominator.
To do this, we need to square $$\sqrt{x-5}$$ so that the denominator doesn't have a square root. So, we have to multiply (3x**2)/(sqrt(x-5) by $$\frac{\sqrt{x-5}}{\sqrt{x-5}}$$.
Since there is no way to simplify the product of $$3x^2 \sqrt{x-5}$$, this leaves us with ((3x**2)(sqrt(x-5))/(x-5)
Remember that $$\frac{g}{f}$$ is the same as $$\frac{g}{f} x$$. All we have to do is divide the two functions.
Let's write the quotient of these functions as a fraction: $$\frac{|x-3|}{\sqrt{x}}$$. Because the bottom of the function is a square root, we need to rationalize the function by getting rid of the square root in the denominator.
To do this, we need to square $$\sqrt{x}$$ so that the denominator doesn't have a square root. So, we have to multiply $$\frac{|x-3|}{\sqrt{x}}$$ by $$\frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{x}}$$.
Since there is no way to simplify the product of $$\sqrt{x} |x-3|$$, this leaves us with $$\frac{\sqrt{x} |x-3|}{x}$$.
Remember that to solve f(g(2)), we need to first find the value of g(2), then plug that value in to f(x).
To find g(2), we need to plug in $$2$$ for the $$x$$ in the function g: $$3(2)-5$$. What is g(2)?
Now, we can plug in the value of g(2) as the $$x$$ into f(x). In other words, we are evaluating f(1).
To find f(1), we plug in $$1$$ for all $$x$$ in f(x), and we get the expression $$2\times1^2+1$$. What does this evaluate to?
Remember that to solve g(f(x)), we need to plug in the value of f(x) into the value of $$x$$ in g(x).
We need to plug in f(x), or $$2x^2+1$$, for the $$x$$ in the function g: $$3\left(2x^2+1\right)+5$$.
Based off the Order of Operations, the first step is the multiply and distribute the 3: $$6x^2+3-5$$.
Now, our composition function reads $$6x^2+3-5$$. The next step is to subtract: $$6x^2+3-5=6x^2-2$$.
Remember that to solve $$f(f(-2))$$, we need to first find the value of $$f(-2)$$, then plug that value back in to f(x).
To find $$f(-2)$$, we need to plug in $$-2$$ for the $$x$$ in the function f: (2(-2)**2)+1. What does this evaluate to?
Our next step is to plug the value of $$f(-2)$$ into f. In other words, we are evaluating f(9).
To find $$f(-2)$$, we need to plug in $$-2$$ for the $$x$$ in the function f: (2(-2)**2)+1. What does this evaluate to?
Remember that to solve f(g(x)), we need to plug in the value of g(x) into the value of $$x$$ in f(x).
We need to plug in g(x), or $$\sqrt{x-2}$$, for the $$x$$ in the function f: $${\sqrt{x+2}}^2+1$$.
Based off the Order of Operations, the first step is the exponents: $${\sqrt{x+2}}^2=x+2$$.
Now, our composition function reads $$x+2+1$$. The next step is to add the constants: $$x+2+1=x+3$$.
Remember that to solve g(f(x)), we need to plug in the value of f(x) into the value of $$x$$ in g(x).
We need to plug in f(x), or $$x^2+1$$, for the $$x$$ in the function f: $$\sqrt{x^2+1+2}$$.
We need to add the constants: $$\sqrt{x^2+2+1}=\sqrt{x^2+3}$$.
Remember that to solve f(g(x)), we need to plug in the value of g(x) into the value of $$x$$ in f(x).
We need to plug in g(x), or $$x^2+3$$, for the $$x$$ in the function f: $$\sqrt{x^2+3}+2$$. There is no way to simplify this expression, so we are left with our final answer.
Remember that to solve g(f(x)), we need to plug in the value of f(x) into the value of $$x$$ in g(x).
We need to plug in f(x), or $$\sqrt{x}+2$$, for the $$x$$ in the function f: $${\left(\sqrt{x}+2\right)}^2+3$$.
Based off the Order of Operations, the first step is the exponent: $${\left(\sqrt{x}+2\right)}^2=x+4\left(\sqrt{x}\right)+4$$.
The expression now reads $$x+4\left(\sqrt{x}\right)+4+3$$. The last step is to add the constants: $$x+4\left(\sqrt{x}\right)+4+3=$$ $$x+4\left(\sqrt{x}\right)+7$$.

Because this is a vertical reflection, we have to reflect the function over the x-axis.
Reflections over the x-axis mean the y-values for each x-value are the opposite of what they would normally be. These are denoted as $$g(x)=-f(x)$$, where g(x) is the reflected function.
What is the expression of s(t) after its reflection?
In this case, $$-f(x)$$ is the same as $$-s(t)$$, or $$-\sqrt{t}$$.
Because this is a horizontal reflection, we have to reflect the function over the y-axis.
Reflections over the y-axis mean the x-values for each y-value are the opposite of what they would normally be. These are denoted as $$g(x)=f(-x)$$, where g(x) is the reflected function.
What is the expression of s(t) after its reflection?
In this case, $$f(-x)$$ is the same as $$s-(t)$$, or $$\sqrt{-t}$$.
Let's start by checking if the function is even. Even functions are defined as functions where $$f(x)=f(-x)$$.
Evaluate $$f(-x)$$. $$f(-x)=-\left(x^3\right)-2x$$. Since this is not equivalent to $$x^3+2x$$, the function is not even.
Now, let's check if the function is odd. Odd functions are defined as functions where $$-f(x)=f(-x)$$.
We already found $$f(-x)$$ when we tested if the function was even, so we just have to evaluate $$-f(x)$$. $$-f(x)=-\left(x^3+2x\right)=-x$$. Since this is equivalent to $$-\left(x^3\right)-2x$$, the function is odd.
Let's start with the horizontal shift. Horizontal shifts are denoted as addition (shift to the left) or subtraction (shift to the right) inside of the parentheses. To shift two units to the left, we add two inside the parentheses.
What does the function look like now?
Vertical shifts denoted as addition (shift upwards) or subtraction (shift downwards) outside of the parentheses. To shift up one unit, we add one units outside the parentheses.

Let's start with the horizontal shift. Horizontal shifts are denoted as addition (shift to the left) or subtraction (shift to the right) inside of the parentheses. Because $$x$$ is being squared in this function, we need to add the shift to $$x$$ before it is squared. To shift four units to the left, we add four to $$x$$ in the denominator, then square that value.
What does the function look like now?
Vertical shifts denoted as addition (shift upwards) or subtraction (shift downwards) outside of the fraction. To shift up two units, we add two outside of the fraction.
What does the function look?
Since intervals are based on x-values, we only have to pay attention to horizontal shifts and reflections. There are no reflections, so we only have to look at the horizontal shifts. The base function of f(x) is $$x^2$$. In $$x^2$$ functions, the graph decreases for every x-value before the vertex, and increases for every x-value after the vertex.
This means that if we find the the x-value of the vertex, we can find where the function increases and decreases.
We have to find the x-value of the vertex of the transformations. The function is horizontally shifted one x-value to the left.
What is the x-value of the vertex?
So, since the vertex is at $$x=-1$$, and $$x^2$$ increases after the vertex and decreases after the vertex, we know what intervals the function increases and decreases on.
Since intervals are based on x-values, we only have to pay attention to horizontal shifts and reflections. There are no reflections, so we only have to look at the horizontal shifts. The base function of f(x) is $$x^2$$. In $$x^2$$ functions, the graph decreases for every x-value before the vertex, and increases for every x-value after the vertex.
This means that if we find the the x-value of the vertex, we can find where the function increases and decreases.
We have to find the x-value of the vertex of the transformations. The function is horizontally shifted three x-value to the left.
What is the x-value of the vertex?
So, since the vertex is at $$x=-3$$, and $$x^2$$ increases after the vertex and decreases after the vertex, we know what intervals the function increases and decreases on.
Since intervals are based on x-values, we only have to pay attention to horizontal shifts and reflections. There is a reflection over the y-axis (denoted by the -x), so we know that the increasing and decreasing intervals will be reversed. The base function of f(x) is $$\sqrt{x}$$. In $$\sqrt{x}$$ functions, the graph increases for every x-value before the vertex starting with $$0$$ and never decreases.
This means that if we find the the x-value that makes $$y=0$$, we can find where the function decreases.
Based on the fact that the function is shifted four units to the left $$+4$$, what is the x-value for $$y=0$$?
So, since $$y=0$$ at $$x=-4$$, and $$\sqrt{-x}$$ decreases before $$y=0$$, we know what intervals the function decreases on.
Since intervals are based on x-values, we only have to pay attention to horizontal shifts and reflections. There is no horizontal shift, so we only look at the reflections. There is a reflection over the x-axis (denoted by the -3), so we know that the increasing and decreasing intervals will be reversed. The base function of f(x) is $$\sqrt{x}$$. In $$\sqrt{x}$$ functions, the graph increases for every x-value before the vertex starting with $$0$$ and never decreases.
This means that if we just need to reverse the intervals where $$\sqrt{x}$$ increases.
So, since $$\sqrt{x}$$ increases on the interval (0, -inf), and k(x) is the opposite of that, we know the interval on which k(x) decreases.

The first step is to recognize the order of transformations. First, $$|x|$$ is reflected over the $$y$$ axis, and then it is horizontally compressed by a factor of $$4$$.
The second step is to reflect the function over the $$y$$ axis by replacing $$x$$ with $$-x$$ in the function. So, find $$f(-x)$$. Remember that absolute value is always positive, so $$|x|=|-x|$$.
What is $$f(-x)$$?
The last step is to compress the graph horizontally by a scale factor of $$\frac{1}{4}$$. The coefficient needed for a horizontal stretch or compression is the reciprocal of the stretch or compression. So to compress the graph horizontally by a scale factor of $$\frac{1}{4}$$, we need a coefficient of $$4$$ in our function. Therefore, replace every $$x$$ in the function with $$4x$$.
What is the function after it has been horizontally compressed by a factor of $$\frac{1}{4}$$?
First, factor out the greatest common factor.
What is the greatest common factor?
Next, factor the remaining trinomial.
Finally, set each factor equal to $$0$$ and find $$x$$ at those values.
First, we must take out $$2t^2$$ using the distributive property. We now have $$C(t)=2t^2 \left(t^2-4t+3\right)$$
We can now factor the expression inside the parenthesis since it is a quadratic. $$t^2-4t+3=(t-3)(t-1)$$. So, our equation is $$C(t)=2t^{2\left(t-3\right)} \left(t-1\right)$$
We must set the whole equation to $$0$$ and solve for $$t$$. $$0=2t^{2\left(t-3\right)} \left(t-1\right)$$. This means that $$t=0$$, $$3$$, and $$1$$. So, our $$t-intercepts$$ are $$(0,0)$$, $$(3,0)$$, and $$(1,0)$$.
We can now factor the expression inside the parenthesis since it is a quadratic. $$t^2-4t+3=(t-3)(t-1)$$. So, our equation is $$C(t)=2t^2 \left(t-3\right) \left(t-1\right)$$
We can now factor the expression inside the parentheses. $$t^2+3t-10=\left(t+5\right) \left(t-2\right)$$. We now have $$C(t)=4t^2 \left(t+5\right) \left(t-2\right)$$
We must now set the whole equation to $$0$$ and solve for $$t$$. $$0=4t^{2\left(t+5\right)} \left(t-2\right)$$. So, $$t=0$$, $$-5$$, and $$2$$. This means our $$t-intercepts$$ are $$(0,0)$$, $$(-5,0)$$, and $$(2,0)$$
First, we must take out $$x^2$$ using the distributive property. We now have $$f(x)=x^2 \left(x^2-1\right)$$
We can now factor the expression inside the parantheses. $$x^2-1=\left(x+1\right) \left(x-1\right)$$. We now have $$f(x)=x^{2\left(x+1\right)} \left(x-1\right)$$
We must now set the whole equation $$0$$ and solve for $$x$$. $$0=x^{2\left(x+1\right)} \left(x-1\right)$$. So, $$x=0, 1$$, and $$-1$$. This means our intercepts are $$(0,0),(1,0)$$, and $$(-1,0)$$
First, we must take out $$x$$ using the distributive property. We now have $$f(x)=x\left(x^2+x-20\right)$$
We must now factor the interior quadratic. $$x^2+x-20=\left(x-5\right) \left(x+4\right)$$. We now have $$f(x)=x\left(x-5\right) \left(x+4\right)$$
We can now set the whole equation to $$0$$ and solve for $$x$$. $$0=x\left(x-5\right) \left(x+4\right)$$. This means that $$x=0, 5$$, and $$-4$$. Thus, our x-intercepts are: $$(0,0),(5,0),(-4,0)$$
First, we must take out $$x^2$$ using the distributive property. We now have $$f(x)=x\left(x^2+6x-7\right)$$.
Now, we must factor the expression inside the parantheses. $$x^2+6x-7=\left(x+7\right) \left(x-1\right)$$. So, we have $$f(x)=x\left(x+7\right) \left(x-1\right)$$
We can now solve the whole equation by setting it equal to $$0$$. $$0=x\left(x+7\right) \left(x-1\right)$$. This means that our x-intercepts are: $$(0,0),(-7,0),(1,0)$$
We can pair together the first and second terms and the third and fourth terms as shown: $$f(x)=x^3+x^2-4x+4$$.
Now, we must take out the common term in both pairs of terms. $$f(x)=x^{2\left(x+1\right)}-4\left(x+1\right)$$.
We can now put together both terms into a single quadratic. $$f(x)=\left(x^2-4\right) \left(x+1\right)$$
We can now factor the quadratic. $$x^2-4=\left(x+2\right) \left(x-2\right)$$. We now have $$f(x)=\left(x+2\right) \left(x-2\right) \left(x+1\right)$$.
We must now set the whole equation to $$0$$ to solve for the x-intercepts. $$0=\left(x+2\right) \left(x-2\right) \left(x+1\right)$$. This means that $$x=-2, 2, -1$$. Our x-intercepts are therefore: $$(-2,0),(2,0),(-1,0)$$
We can pair together the first and second terms and the third and fourth terms so that we can later factor. This can be done as shown. $$f(x)=x^3+2x^2+\left(-9x-18\right)$$
We must now take out the common term(s) in each pair. $$f(x)=x^{2\left(x+2\right)}-9\left(x+2\right)$$
Now we must join together both terms by using the common term that was pulled out. $$f(x)=\left(x^2-9\right) \left(x+2\right)$$
Finally, we can factor each expression in the parantheses. $$x^2-9=\left(x+3\right) \left(x-3\right)$$. This means that $$f(x)=\left(x+3\right) \left(x-2\right) \left(x+2\right)$$.
We can set the factored equation from the previous step equal to $$0$$ in order to solve for $$x$$. $$0=\left(x+3\right) \left(x-2\right) \left(x+2\right)$$. This means that $$x=-3$$, $$2$$, and $$-2$$. This, then, means that our x-intercepts are $$(-3,0),(2,0),(-2,0)$$
We can pair together the first and second terms and the third and fourth terms as shown: $$f(x)=2x^3-x^2+\left(-8x+4\right)$$
We can now take out a common term from each of the groupings as shown. $$f(x)=x^{2\left(2x-1\right)}-4\left(2x-1\right)$$
Now, we must merge both terms into a single expression. $$f(x)=\left(x^2-4\right) \left(2x-1\right)$$
We can actually factor $$x^2-4$$ into $$\left(x+2\right) \left(x-2\right)$$. Now, $$f(x)=\left(x+2\right) \left(x-2\right) \left(2x-1\right)$$.
We can set the equation equal to $$0$$. $$0=\left(x+2\right) \left(x-2\right) \left(2x-1\right)$$. This means that $$x=-2$$, $$2$$, and $$\frac{1}{2}$$. So, our x-intercepts are (-2,0),(2,0),(1/2,0)
We can let $$t=x^3$$ and substitute into the equation. We now have $$g(t)=t^2-7t-8$$. This is a quadratic that we can factor normally.
Using factoring, we can convert $$t^2-7t-8$$ to $$\left(t-8\right) \left(t+1\right)$$. So, our equation is now $$g(t)=\left(t-8\right) \left(t+1\right)$$.
We can now solve for $$t$$ by setting the equation equal to $$0$$. $$0=\left(t-8\right) \left(t+1\right)$$. $$t=8, -1$$.
Since we know the values of $$t$$, we can take their cube root to find the values of $$x$$. $$x=2, -1$$. This means our intercepts are $$(2,0)$$ and $$(-1,0)$$.
We can let $$t=x^2$$ and substitute into the equation. We now have $$g(t)=2t^2+6t-8$$
We now factor the quadratic from the previous step. $$g(t)=2\left(t+4\right) \left(t-1\right)$$
We can set the equation equal to $$0$$. $$0=2\left(t+4\right) \left(t-1\right)$$. This means that $$t=1$$ and $$-4$$.
We can now take the square root of the values of $$t$$ to get the values of $$x$$. This means that $$x=1$$ and $$-1$$, since there is no real square root of $$-4$$. So, our intercept is $$(1,0),(-1,0)$$
First, factor by grouping.
What is the result after factoring by grouping? $$f(x)=$$?
Next, factor out the difference of squares.
Finally, set each factor to $$0$$ and solve for $$x$$.
We can pair together the first and second terms and the second and third terms as shown. $$f(x)=x^3-3x^2+\left(-x+3\right)$$
We can now take out the common terms as shown: $$f(x)=x^{2\left(x-3\right)}-x-3$$
We can now join the whole equation into a single expression. $$f(x)=\left(x^2-1\right) \left(x-3\right)$$
Since $$x^2-1=\left(x+1\right) \left(x-1\right)$$, we can simplify the function to $$f(x)=\left(x+1\right) \left(x-1\right) \left(x-3\right)$$.
We must now solve for $$x$$ by setting the whole equation to $$0$$. $$0=\left(x+1\right) \left(x-1\right) \left(x-3\right)$$. This means that $$x=-1, 1$$, and $$3$$. Our intercepts are thus: $$(-1,0),(1,0),(3,0)$$

Looking at the graph of the function, it appears that there are $$x$$ intercepts at $$x=-3$$, $$x=-2$$, and $$x=1$$.
A turning point is a point of the graph where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing (rising to falling) or decreasing to increasing (falling to rising).
A polynomial of degree $$n$$ has at most $$n-1$$ turning points.
A turning point is a point of the graph where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing (rising to falling) or decreasing to increasing (falling to rising).
Expand the polynomial to identify the degree of its leading term.
A polynomial of degree $$n$$ has at most $$n-1$$ turning points.
This graph has three x-intercepts: $$x=-3, 2$$, and $$5$$. The y-intercept is located at $$(0,2)$$.
At $$x=-3$$ and $$x=5$$, the graph passes through the axis linearly, suggesting the corresponding factors of the polynomial will be linear.
At $$x=2$$, the graph bounces at the intercept, suggesting the corresponding factor of the polynomial will be second degree (quadratic).
Together, this gives us $$f(x)=a\left(x+3\right) {\left(x-2\right)}^2 \left(x-5\right)$$.
To determine the stretch factor, we utilize another point on the graph. We will use the y-intercept $$(0,-2)$$, to solve for a.
When $$f(x)=-2$$ and $$x=0$$, $$a=$$?

There is very little information given hinting that if we know some fundamental characteristics of continuous probability distribution, we can find the probability.
In a continuous probability distribution, the total area in the distribution is $$_{}$$.
The area under the curve of a continuous probability distribution is $$1$$, so the area that is outside of the curve is $$0$$.
The area under probability density functions must be $$1$$ in total to accurately model the experiment.

Since the tail is to the right, we call this distribution right skewed
The shaded area should be covered by whatever the X limits are in the inquality statement.

First choose an expression for u.
Which expression for u would be most appropriate for substitution?
We choose $$u=3x^2+4$$ because then $$du=6xdx$$, and we already have du in the integrand.
Write the integral in terms of u.
Remember that du is the derivative of the expresion chosen for u, regardless of what is inside the integrand. Evaluate the integral with respect to u.
Replace u with $$3x^2+4$$.

Rewrite the integral as $$\int z\left({\left(z^2-5\right)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\right) \,dz$$.
Let $$u=z^2-5$$ and $$du=2zdz$$. Our new concern is that $$du=2zdz$$ and the original expression has only xdz.
Alter the expression for du or the integral in u will be twice as large as it should be. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the du equation by $$\frac{1}{2}$$.
Write the integral in terms of u, but pull the $$\frac{1}{2}$$ outside the integration symbol.

What is the slope of the function?
Is this slope constant for every increase in $$x$$?
Does this mean it can be written as a linear function?
Subtract y2 - y1.
What is this value?
Subtract x2 - x1.
What is this value?
What is y2-y1 over x2-x1?
The slope formula can be defined as follows: $$m=\frac{y1-y2}{x1-x2}$$, where (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the points on the line.
We can plug in the points $$(2,3)$$ and $$(0,4)$$ into the slope formula as shown. $$m$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{4-3}{0-2}$$.
What is the numerical result of the previous step?
We can create two points with the information given. We know that the town's population in $$2009$$ was $$1442$$, so we can create the point $$(2009,1442)$$. We are also given that the town's population in $$2012$$ was $$1868$$, so we can create another point $$(2012,1868)$$
The slope formula can be defined as follows: $$m=\frac{y1-y2}{x1-x2}$$, where (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the points on the line.
We can plug in the points $$(2009,1442)$$ and $$(2012,1868)$$ into the slope formula as shown. $$m$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{1868-1442}{2012-2009}$$.
What is the numerical result of the previous step?
We are given that $$f(2)=-11and$$ $$f(4)=-25$$, so we can create the points $$(2,-11)$$ and $$(4,-25)$$, respectively.
We can now use the points to calculate the slope using the formula $$m$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{y1-y2}{x1-x2}$$. $$m=\frac{\left(-25\right)-\left(-11\right)}{4-2}$$. $$m=-7$$.
Using the calculated slope and one of the previous points, we can create an equation in point-slope form as shown. $$y+11=-7(x-2)$$
We now rewrite the equation such that it is in point-slope form. $$y=-7x+3$$.
We must now set the equation equal to $$0$$ as shown: $$0=\frac{1}{4} x-4$$.
We now solve the equation by isolating the $$x$$ term. $$4=\frac{1}{4} x$$ --> $$x=16$$.
Since we solve for $$x$$ as $$16$$, we know the x-intercept is $$(16,0)$$
For any x-value, the y-value is $$-4$$. So the equation of the line must be $$y=-4$$.
The x-value is constantly $$7$$, so the equation of the line must be $$x=7$$.
Because we know that parallel lines have the same slope, we need to find the slope of the original line. The equation is in slope-intercept form, so we know the slope is 3; this means that the slope of the parallel line is also $$3$$.
If we substitute $$m=3$$ into $$y=mx+b$$, we have $$y=3x+b$$
We now solve for $$b$$ in the equation $$y=3x+b$$. Plugging in the point $$(3,0)$$, we get $$0=9+b$$ --> $$b=-0$$. So, the final equation is $$y=3x-9$$
We know that a perpendicular line must have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the original line's slope. The negative reciprocal of the original slope, $$3$$, is $$\frac{-1}{3}$$.
If we substitute $$m=\frac{-1}{3}$$ into the form $$y=mx+b$$, we get $$y=\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) x+b$$.
Since we know that the line passes through the point $$(3,0)$$, we can create the equation $$0=-1+b$$. From this, we get $$b=1$$. So, $$y=\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) x+1$$
Using the slope formula, $$m=\frac{y1-y2}{x1-x2}$$, we can calculate the slope. $$m=\frac{6-5}{\left(-2-4\right)}$$. $$m=\frac{-1}{6}$$
Since we know that a perpendicular line has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the original line's, we can calculate the slope. The negative reciprocal of $$\frac{-1}{6}$$ is $$6$$, so $$6$$ is the slope of the perpendicular line.
We can now plug in $$m=6$$ into the equation $$y=mx+b$$. We now have $$y=6x+b$$.
We can plug in the point $$(4,5)$$ since we know the line passes through this point. We now have $$5=24+b$$. Solving for $$b$$, we get $$b=-19$$. Now we must plug this into the equation derived in the previous step: $$y=6x-19$$ is the equation of the perpendicular line.
Subtract $$3x$$ from both sides.
Divide both sides by $$5$$.

Let's try to rewrite this in equation form. We can make our variable $$x$$ where $$x$$ $$=$$ the number of days
We can rewrite it to be f(x) $$=$$ $$60x$$ because that is how many texts are sent each day
To see if our function is increasing, decreasing, or constant, we have to check the slope. Is the slope positive, constant, or negative?
We see that $$60$$ is positive which means our function is increasing

Let's try to rewrite this in equation form. We can make our variable $$x$$ where $$x$$ $$=$$ the number of days
To see if our function is increasing, decreasing, or constant, we have to check the slope. Is the slope positive, constant, or negative?
We see that $$-60$$ is negative which means our function is decreasing
Let's try to rewrite this in equation form. We can make our variable $$x$$ where $$x$$ $$=$$ the number of days
We can rewrite it to be f(x) $$=$$ $$50$$ because the number of days does not affect the price
To see if our function is increasing, decreasing, or constant, we have to check the slope. Is the slope positive, constant, or negative?
We see that our slope is $$0$$, which means our function is constant.
We know that to find if the function is increasing, constant, or decreasing we must find the slope. To do so, we can use our slope formula.
The formula is (change in output)/(change in input).
$$m=\frac{1-\left(-2\right)}{8-3}$$
When we solve, we get $$\frac{3}{5}$$ as our slope
We see that our slope is $$\frac{3}{5}$$, a positive number, which means our function is increasing.
First, let's calculate the change in people
The change in people is $$27800-23400=4400$$ people
Next, let's calculate the number of years
The number of years is $$2012-2008=4$$
To find the rate of change divide the change in people over the change in years
$$\frac{4400}{4}$$ $$=$$ $$1100$$
Identify two points on the line, such as $$(0,2)$$ and $$(-2,-4)$$. Use the points to calculate the slope.
$$m=\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$$
$$\frac{\left(-4-2\right)}{\left(-2-0\right)}$$
$$3$$
Substitute the slope and the coordinates of one of the points into the point-slope form.
$$y-y1=m(x-x1)$$
$$y-(-4)$$ $$=$$ $$3(x-(-2))$$
$$y+4=3\left(x+2\right)$$
Rewrite in form $$y=mx+b$$
$$y=3x+2$$
We can rewrite this to C(x) $$=$$ $$1270+37.5x$$
We can plug in $$100$$ for $$x$$
We can solve $$1250+\operatorname{37.5}\left(100\right)$$ $$=$$ $$5000$$
We can rewrite the given to coordinate form to get $$(3,-2)$$ and $$(8,1)$$
$$m=\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$$
What is (1-(-2)/(8-3)?
Substitute the slope and the coordinates of one of the points into the point-slope form.
$$y-y1=m(x-x1)$$
$$y-(-2)$$ $$=$$ (3/5)(x-3))
$$y+2=\frac{3}{5} \left(x-3\right)$$
rewrite in form $$y=mx+b$$
$$y=\frac{3}{5} x-\frac{19}{5}$$
In our slope-intercept form, our $$b$$ value is the initial amount which is $$200$$.
Our $$m$$ value is how much it is increasing per month which would be $$15$$
Our equation is now N(t) $$=$$ $$15t$$ + $$200$$
If we plug in $$12$$ for $$t$$ which is the number of months in a year, we get N(12) $$=$$ $$15\times12$$ + $$200$$
This equals $$380$$
We are given two point pairs: $$(3,760)$$ and $$(5,920)$$ and we can plug it into our slope formula to find the slope
$$m=\frac{920-760}{5-3}$$ $$=$$ $80 per policy
We can put it into slope-intercept form to get I(n) $$=$$ $$80n$$ + $$b$$
We know I(3) $$=$$ $$760$$ so $$760-80(3)$$ $$=$$ $$520$$
Rewrite the final equation as I(n) $$=$$ $$80n$$ + $$520$$
We know that the intital value is $$1000$$ so $$b=1000$$
We see that the number increases by $$80$$ every $$2$$ weeks, so $$m=40$$
When we rewrite, we get P(w) $$=$$ $$40w+1000$$

Two Population Means with Unknown Standard Deviations, Degrees of Freedom, T-Score, Standard Error
$$H_0$$ is the null hypothesis and $$H_a$$ is the alternative hypothesis. $$H_0$$: $$μ_g$$ $$=$$ $$μ_b$$ where $$μ_g$$ - $$μ_b$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ and $$H_a$$: $$μ_g$$ $$ \neq $$ $$μ_b$$ where $$H_a$$: $$μ_g$$ $$=$$ $$μ_b$$ $$ \neq $$ $$0$$. When the problems says that the means are the same, this tells you that $$H_0$$ has an equals sign. Since there are no other words to indicate $$H_a$$, assume it says that the means are different. This is a two-tailed test.

The problem says to test at a 1% significance level, meaning that the $$p-value$$ threshold is $$0.01$$. If $$p-value$$ < $$0.01$$, reject $$H_0$$. This means that you would be rejecting $$μ_1$$ $$=$$ $$μ_2$$, and the means are different. If $$p-value$$ $$ \geq $$ $$0.01$$, accept $$H_0$$ such that $$μ_1$$ $$=$$ $$μ_2$$, and the means are the same.
Using a calculator, what is the $$p-value$$? Round to four decimal places.

The professor was correct. The evidence shows that the mean of the final exam scores for the online class is lower than that of the face-to-face class. At the 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean of the final exam scores for the online class is less than the mean of final exam scores of the face-to-face class.
Cohen's $$d$$ is a measure of effect size based on the differences between two means. Specifically, it is the measure of the difference between two means divided by the pooled standard deviation. The calculated value of effect size is then compared to Cohen’s standards of small, medium, and large effect sizes: if the size of effect is small, $$d$$ $$=$$ $$0.2;$$ for medium, $$d$$ $$=$$ $$0.5;$$ for large, $$d$$ $$=$$ $$0.8$$.\n##figure2.gif##

The effect is small because $$0.384$$ is between Cohen’s value of $$0.2$$ for small effect size and $$0.5$$ for medium effect size. The size of the differences of the means for the two colleges is small indicating that there is not a significant difference between them.
Examine the problem to determine whether or not the standard deviations of the populations were stated. Keep in mind that samples are only representative of populations.
Does the study use populations or samples?

The problem states that "the community group believes that a student who graduates from college A has taken more math classes, on the average." This statement is the alternative hypothesis (what the community group is trying to prove), where the population mean of college A, $$μ_A$$, is greater than the population mean of college B, $$μ_B$$. The null hypothesis should be the opposite of the alternative hypothesis.

Let $$x$$ equal the number of quarters and $$y$$ equal the number of dimes. $$0.25x+0.1y=8.55$$, $$x-2y=3$$
Let's solve for $$x$$ so that we can isolate $$y$$ in the equation. $$x=2y+3$$. Substituting this into the other equation, we get: $$\operatorname{0.25}\left(2y+3\right)+0.1y=8.55$$
We can now solve this equation for $$y$$ to find the number of dimes. $$0.6y=7.8$$, $$y=\frac{7.8}{0.6}=13$$. She has $$13$$ dimes.

We can restrict this function to a domain on which it will be one-to-one.
We can see this is a parabola with vertex at $$(2,-3)$$ that opens upward. Because the graph will be decreasing on one side of the vertex and increasing on the other side, we can restrict this function to a domain on which it will be one-to-one by limiting the domain to $$x \geq 2$$.

Because a square root is only defined when the quantity under the radical is non-negative, we need to determine where $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x-3\right)}{x-1} \geq 0$$. The output of a rational function can change signs (change from positive to negative or vice versa) at x-intercepts and at vertical asymptotes. For this equation, where can the graph change signs?
Where does the equation change sign? They usually occur around zeros and asymptotes, for e.g. consider $$(x-1)$$, $$x-1>0$$ at $$x=1.01$$, $$x-1<0$$ at $$x=0.99$$.
For each expression, $$x+2$$, $$(x-3)$$, $$(x-1)$$, we know that there is a point beyond which the expression becomes either positive or negative. By finding the product of the sign of each expressions, we can evaluate the sign of the overall equation. For instance, at $$x=-\infty$$, $$x+2$$, $$(x-3)$$, $$(x-1)$$ < $$0$$, hence their product would yield an overall equation that is negative at $$x=-\infty$$. By finding where $$f(x) \geq 0$$, we can find the domain of the function.
How many different range of values should we test? E.g. $$(-\infty,0]$$, $$(0,\infty)$$ would be considered $$2$$.
Check if the equation, $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x-3\right)}{x-1}$$, is positive or negative for values in this range. If it is positive then f(x) will have a real output, and thus this range is part of the domain.
Check if the equation, $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x-3\right)}{x-1}$$, is positive or negative for values in this range. Substitute $$x=-3$$.
Check if the equation, $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x-3\right)}{x-1}$$, is positive or negative for values in this range. If it is positive then f(x) will have a real output, and thus this range is part of the domain.

Check if the equation, $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x-3\right)}{x-1}$$, is positive or negative for values in this range. If it is positive then f(x) will have a real output, and thus this range is part of the domain.

Check if the equation, $$\frac{\left(x+2\right) \left(x-3\right)}{x-1}$$, is positive or negative for values in this range. Substitute $$x=4$$.
Now that you've found the range for which f(x) is valid, the domain is the intersection of these union of these ranges.
The general process for finding an inverse is as follow:\nGiven a polynomial function, restrict the domain of a function that is not one-to-one and then find the inverse.\n1) Restrict the domain by determining a domain on which the original function is one-to-one.\n2) Replace f(x) with $$y$$.\n3) Interchange $$x$$ and $$y$$.\n4) Solve for $$y$$, and rename the function or pair of function $$f^{-1\left(x\right)}$$.\n5) Revise the formula for $$f^{-1\left(x\right)}$$ by ensuring that the outputs of the inverse function correspond to the restricted domain of the original function.\nHowever, note that in real-world applications, we do not swap the variables when finding inverses. Instead, we change which variable is considered to be the independent variable.
Notice that in this question, $$n$$ and C would not be meaningful when they are less than $$0$$. Thus, the domain and range for them are from zero to $$\infty$$.
Make $$n$$ the subject of the equation, $$C=\frac{20+0.4n}{100+n}$$.
Multiply the denominator in the fraction to both sides.
Expand out $$C \left(100+n\right)$$
Move the $$n$$ terms to the same side of the equation so that we can isolate $$n$$.
Factorize out $$n$$.
Divide the coefficient of $$n$$ from both sides to make $$n$$ the subject. What is $$n$$?
Substitute $$C=0.35$$ and solve for $$n$$. Leave your answer in $$3$$ significant figures.

When looking at a tree diagram, it consists of "branches", sometimes labeled with frequencies (whole numbers) or probabilities (fractions). Each branch of the tree represents a "choice" of sorts and each level represents the completion of a choice, and at the bottom of the tree--the leaf--houses the final outcomes. To get to the final outcome, you want to multiply all the probabilities going down the tree from the top to the end of the leaf.

We add and subtract $$9$$ units to the center of the hyperbola along the transverse axis to find the two vertices. Given the center is $$(0,0)$$. What are the foci?
The standard form for hyperbola is either $$\frac{{\left(x-h\right)}^2}{a^2}-\frac{{\left(y-k\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$\nor $$\frac{{\left(y-k\right)}^2}{a^2}-\frac{{\left(x-h\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$ depending on the transverse axis.
We want to square the denominator to get a and $$b$$ so that we can express in the standard form.
The standard form for hyperbola is either $$\frac{{\left(x-h\right)}^2}{a^2}-\frac{{\left(y-k\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$\nor $$\frac{{\left(y-k\right)}^2}{a^2}-\frac{{\left(x-h\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$ depending on the transverse axis.
We observe that in the standard form of hyperbola that the two terms have opposing signs (the first term is positive in sign and the second term is negative). We observe that the coefficient of the $$x^2$$ and $$y^2$$ terms are both positive. We will not be able to manipulate the equation to obtain opposing signs. What does this tells us about whether the equation is a hyperbola.
The standard form for hyperbola is either $$\frac{{\left(x-h\right)}^2}{a^2}-\frac{{\left(y-k\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$\nor $$\frac{{\left(y-k\right)}^2}{a^2}-\frac{{\left(x-h\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$ depending on the transverse axis.
If we are not able to tell directly whether an equation is a hyperbola using properties of the equation, we can attempt to force out a similar form to check.
We would want to make the RHS $$1$$. We can do so by dividing the equation by $$400$$ on both side.
We observe that there is no coefficient on the numerator. This tells us we should remove the coefficient of $$x^2$$ and $$y^2$$. We can do so by dividing the denominator by the coefficient. We would thus divide $$400$$ by $$25$$ for the $$x^2$$ term and divide $$400$$ by $$16$$ for the $$y^2$$ term. What is the current expression?
We observe that the equation we found has the form of a hyperbola. We want to square the denominator to get a and $$b$$ so that we can express in the standard form.

When there is an $$x^2$$ and $$x$$ term, we can complete the square to obtain an expression that is easier to work with. For $$a x^2+b x$$, we can re-express this as a*(x**2+b/a*x)=a*(x**2+b/a*x+(b/(2*a))**2-(b/(2*a))**2)=a*(x**2+b/a*x+(b/(2*a))**2)-a*(b/(2*a))**2)=a*(x+b/(2*a))**2-a*(b/(2*a))**2)

We would want to make the RHS $$1$$. We can do so by dividing the equation by $$9$$ on both side.
We observe that there is no coefficient on the numerator. This tells us we should remove the coefficient of $$x^2$$ and $$y^2$$. We can do so by dividing the denominator by the coefficient. We would thus divide the denominator $$9$$ by $$9$$ for the $$x^2$$ term and divide the denominator $$9$$ by $$1$$ for the $$y^2$$ term. What is the current expression?

What is the equation when plugging in known values?
Express the equation in standard form by first grouping the terms with the same variable so you get $$9x^2-18x-16y^2+32y=151$$
Factor the leading coefficient of each expression so you get $$9\left(x^2-2x\right)-\operatorname{16}\left(y^2-2y\right)=151$$
Complete the square twice and make sure to balance the equation by adding same constants on each side so you'll have $$9\left(x^2-2x+1\right)-\operatorname{16}\left(y^2-2y+1\right)=151+9-16$$
Rewrite as perfect squares and divide both sides by constants so that it's in standard form $$\frac{{\left(x-1\right)}^2}{4^2}-\frac{{\left(y-1\right)}^2}{3^2}=1$$

Now we need to find $$c^2$$. The coordinates of the foci are (h~c,k). So $$(h+c,k)=(12,1)$$. We can use the x-coordinate from this point to solve for c using $$h=6$$ so $$c=6$$ and $$c^2=36$$
Next, solve for $$b^2$$ using the equation $$b^2=c^2-a^2=36-25=11$$

Which axis is transverse axis on? We can tell based on vertices.
Since the transverse axis is on the x-axis, which standard form for hyperbola should we use?
We observe that the distance between the vertices (the closest distance between the two sides) is $$60m$$ with the center at $$(0,0)$$. The length of the transverse axis, 2a, is bounded by the vertices. We can thus find a by dividing the length between the two vertices by $$2$$. What is a in the standard form of hyperbola?
Since there are no information about loci directly provided, we need to substitute for $$x$$ and $$y$$ in our equation using a known point.point. To do this, we can use the dimensions of the tower to find some point (x,y) that lies on the hyperbola. We will use the top right corner of the tower to represent that point. Since the y-axis bisects the tower, our x-value can be represented by the radius of the top, or $$36$$ meters. The y-value is represented by the distance from the origin to the top, which is given as $$79.6$$ meters. We can thus substitute $$(36, 79.6)$$ and $$a=30$$ into our equation to solve for $$b$$.

Which axis is transverse axis on? We can tell based on vertices.
Since the transverse axis is on the x-axis, which standard form for hyperbola should we use?
We observe that the distance between the vertices (the closest distance between the two sides) is $$40m$$ with the center at $$(0,0)$$. The length of the transverse axis, 2a, is bounded by the vertices. We can thus find a by dividing the length between the two vertices by $$2$$. What is a in the standard form of hyperbola?
Since there are no information about loci directly provided, we need to substitute for $$x$$ and $$y$$ in our equation using a known point.point. To do this, we can use the dimensions of the tower to find some point (x,y) that lies on the hyperbola. We will use the top right corner of the tower to represent that point. Since the y-axis bisects the tower, our x-value can be represented by the radius of the top, or $$30$$ meters. The y-value is represented by the distance from the origin to the top, which is given as $$67.082$$ meters. We can thus substitute $$(30, 67.082)$$ and $$a=20$$ into our equation to solve for $$b$$.
We want to isolate $$b$$ in the standard form $$\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$$. Isolating $$b$$, what is the algebraic expression that $$b$$ is equals to?
Having found an expression for $$b$$, we now substitute in $$x=20$$, $$y=67.082$$ and $$a=20$$ as previously explained. What is $$b$$? Round to four decimal places.
Having found a and $$b$$, we can now substitute them into the standard form equation $$\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$$
The standard form for hyperbola is either $$\frac{{\left(x-h\right)}^2}{a^2}-\frac{{\left(y-k\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$\nor $$\frac{{\left(y-k\right)}^2}{a^2}-\frac{{\left(x-h\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$ depending on the transverse axis.
Observe that only one of the variables, $$y$$, is of degree $$2$$, while $$x$$ is of degree $$1$$. Thus, this is a parabola.
We want to apply the slicing method to a pyramid with a square base. To set up the integral, consider figure (a) the pyramid shown in the figure, oriented along the x-axis, and figure (b) a two-dimentional view of the pyramid from the side.\n##figure1.gif##
First, determine the shape of a cross-section of the pyramid. Since the base is a square, the cross-sections will also be squares.
Next, determine a formula for the area of one of the cross-sectional squares. Looking at figure (b), and using a proportion, since these are similar triangles, we have $$\frac{s}{a}=\frac{x}{h}$$.
What is the formula in terms of s? Please write the full formula.
The area of one of the cross-sectional squares is $$A(x)=s^2={\left(\frac{ax}{h}\right)}^2$$. The integral for the volume of the pyramid is $$V=\int_{0}^{h} A(x) \,dx=\int_{0}^{h} {\left(\frac{a x}{h}\right)}^2 \,dx=(a**2/h**2)*/int(x**2),0,h,x}$$.
Integrating from $$0$$ to $$h$$, we receive the formula we were looking for: $$V=\frac{1}{3} a^2 h$$.

Since the solid was formed by revolving the region around the x-axis, the cross-sections are circles.

(b) Revolving the region about the line $$y=-2$$ generates a solid of revolution with a cylindrical hole through its middle.\n##figure1.gif##
We cannot apply the formula to this problem directly because the axis of revolution is not one of the coordinate axes. However, we still know that the area of the cross-section is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. Looking at the graph of the function, we see the radius of the outer circle is given by $$f{\left(x\right)}+2$$.
What is $$f{\left(x\right)}+2$$?
The radius of the inner circle is $$g(x)=2$$. Therefore, we have $$V=\int_{0}^{4} \pi {\left(6-x\right)}^2-2^2 \,dx$$.

We have enough information to figure out the vertical dimensions-- the height-- of the parallelogram. We know that the parallelogram is bounded by $$g(x)=2$$ and the $$x$$ axis, so the height is $$2$$.
We can figure out the horizontal dimensions by first finding the equation of the line that passes through $$(6,1)$$, then finding its $$x$$ values when $$y$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ (meaning it intersects the $$x$$ axis) and when it intersects $$g(x)=2$$.
We know that the line passing through $$(6,1)$$ is parallel to $$f(x)=3x$$. What this means is that the line we want to find also has a slope of $$3$$. Since we know the slope of the line and a point on the line, we can plug this into the equation $$y=mx+b$$ to find $$b$$. We know that the point $$(6,1)$$ means $$y=1$$ and $$x=6$$, and the slope, $$m$$, is $$3$$. Thus, $$1=3\left(6\right)+b$$. Solving for $$b$$, we get that $$b=-17$$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $$3x-17$$.
Using the equation of the line $$y=3x-17$$, when $$y=0$$, what is $$x$$?
Using the equation of the line $$y=3x-17$$, when $$y=2$$, what is $$x$$?
We now know that the horizontal base of the paralleogram is starts at $$x=\frac{17}{3}$$ and ends at $$y=\frac{19}{3}$$. We can find the length of the base by subtracting $$\frac{17}{3}$$ from $$\frac{19}{3}$$, which gives us $$\frac{2}{3}$$.
The area of a parallelogram is the height times the base. In equation form, $$A=bh$$.

Input $$12$$ as the $$x$$ value. Then, calculate the equation using that value.
$$75000+2500\times12=$$?
The first step is to identity the changing quantities. From the problem, we can see that the year town populations change, so our variables are "time" and "population."
The next step is to define input and output. Our input is "time," and our output is "population." To make the input nicer, instead of defining time with the year number, we will let time, represented by the variable $$t$$, be equal to the number of years after $$2004$$. Thus, in $$2004$$, $$t$$ $$=$$ $$0$$. Our output is P(t), which represents population as a function of time.
We need to determine the rate of change-- that is, the change in output over the change in input. This is equivalent to the slope of the linear model, which is constant by the definition of linearity (a line.)
In $$2004$$, $$t$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ and P(t) $$=$$ $$6200$$. We can represent this with the coordinate point $$(0,6200)$$. In $$2009$$, $$t$$ $$=$$ $$5$$ (since $$2009-2004=5)$$ and P(t) $$=$$ $$8100$$, giving us the point $$(5,8100)$$. The slope, $$m$$, is calculated as the change in $$y$$ over the change in $$x$$.
What is $$8100-6200$$?
What is $$5-0$$?
What is $$\frac{1900}{5}$$?
We have determined that the slope is $$380$$ $$\frac{people}{year}$$ (since we dividing the change in $$y$$, which was in units of people, by the change in $$x$$, which was in units of years.) For the equation of the line, we need to know the y-intercept, which occurs when $$t$$ $$=$$ $$0$$.
When $$t=0$$, $$P(t)=$$?
The slope is $$380$$ and the $$y$$ intercept is $$6200$$, so we know the line $$y$$ $$=$$ mx + $$b$$, with $$y$$ being P(t), $$x$$ being $$t$$, $$m$$ being slope, and $$b$$ being the y-intercept, is $$P(t)=380t+6200$$.
To predict the population in $$2013$$, we find the value of P(t) when $$t$$ $$=$$ $$9$$ (Since $$2013-2004=9)$$.
When $$t$$ $$=$$ $$9$$, and $$P(t)=380t+6200$$, what is the value of P(9)?
We are given that the population, P(t), is equal to $$15000$$, so now we need to solve for $$t$$. Using the equation obtained in part a, we get that $$15000=380t+6200$$.
$$15000=380t+6200$$, so $$15000-6200=380t$$. $$t$$ is equal to about?
The first step is to identify the changing variables and assigning them to input and output. Our input will be $$t$$, time in hours, and our output will be A(t), distance in miles, and E(t), distance in miles.
Because it is not obvious how to define our output variable, we’ll start by drawing a picture such as in the image attached to this hint.\n##figure1.gif##
They both start at the same intersection so when $$t=0$$, the distance traveled by each person should also be $$0$$. Thus the initial value for each is $$0$$.
Anna is walking $$4$$ miles per hour and Emanuel is walking $$3$$ miles per hour, which are both rates of change. The slope for A is $$4$$ and the slope for E is $$3$$.
For this problem, the distances from the starting point are important. To notate these, we can define a coordinate system, identifying the “starting point” at the intersection where they both started. Then we can use the variable, A, which we introduced above, to represent Anna’s position, and define it to be a measurement from the starting point in the eastward direction. Likewise, can use the variable, E, to represent Emanuel’s position, measured from the starting point in the southward direction. Note that in defining the coordinate system, we specified both the starting point of the measurement and the direction of measure.
We can then define a third variable, D, to be the measurement of the distance between Anna and Emanuel. Showing the variables on the diagram is often helpful, as we can see from the attached image. Recall that we need to know how long it takes for D, the distance between them, to equal $$2$$ miles. Notice that for any given input 𝑡, the outputs A(t), E(t), and D(t) represent distances.\n##figure2.gif##

$$D(t)=5t;$$ this means that the distance between Anna and Emanuel is also a linear function. Because D is a linear function, we can now answer the question of when the distance between them will reach $$2$$ miles. We will set the output $$D(t)=2D(t)=2$$ and solve for $$t$$.
$$D(t)=5t$$, so $$5t=2$$. $$t=$$?
It might help here to draw a picture of the situation. See the attached image. It would then be helpful to introduce a coordinate system. While we could place the origin anywhere, placing it at Westborough seems convenient. This puts Agritown at coordinates $$(30,10),(30,10)$$, and Eastborough at $$(20,0)$$.
Using the point $$(30,10)$$, we can find the slope of the line from Westborough to Agritown. Slope $$=$$ Change in $$\frac{y}{Change}$$ in $$x$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{30-0}{10-0}=3$$.
Now we can write an equation to describe the road from Westborough to Agritown, $$W(x)=\frac{1}{3} x$$. From this, we can determine the perpendicular road to Eastborough will have slope $$m=-3$$. Because the town of Eastborough is at the point $$(20,0)$$, we can find the equation.
$$E(x)=-3x+b$$. When $$x=20$$, $$b=$$?
We can now find the coordinates of the junction of the roads by finding the intersection of these lines. Setting them equal, $$\frac{1}{3} x=-3x+60$$.
$$\frac{1}{3} x=-3x+60$$, $$x=$$?
Next, subsitute $$x=18$$ back into the original equation. $$y=W(18)=\frac{1}{3\left(18\right)}$$.
$$y=\frac{1}{3\left(18\right)}$$, $$y=$$?
Thus, the roads intersect at $$(18,6)$$. Using the distance formula, we can now find the distance from Westborough to the junction.
The first step is to indentify input and output. The input is $$d$$, distance driven in miles; the outputs are K(d): cost, in dollars, for renting from Keep on Trucking, and M(d): cost, in dollars, for renting from Move It Your Way.
The initial value is the up-front fee: $$K(0)=20$$ and $$M(0)=16;$$ the rates of change are $$K(d)=\$0.59$$ /mile and $$P(d)=\$0.63$$ /mile.
A linear function is of the form $$f(x)=mx+b$$. Using the rates of change and initial charges, we can write the equations $$K(d)=0.59d+20$$ and $$M(d)=0.63d+16$$.
Using these equations, we can determine when Keep on Trucking, Inc., will be the better choice. Because all we have to make that decision from is the costs, we are looking for when Move It Your Way, will cost less, or when $$K\left(d\right)<M\left(d\right)$$. The solution pathway will lead us to find the equations for the two functions, find the intersection, and then see where the K(d) function is smaller. The attached image shows the graph of the two functions, with K(d) in blue.\n##figure1.gif##
To find the intersection, we set the equations equal and solve. $$K(d)=M(d)$$, so $$0.59d+20=0.63d+16$$.
$$0.59d+20=0.63d+16$$, $$d=$$?
The value of $$d$$ tells us that the cost from the two companies will be the same if $$100$$ miles are driven. Either by looking at the graph, or noting that K(d) is growing at a slower rate, we can conclude that Keep on Trucking, Inc. will be the cheaper price when more than $$100$$ miles are driven, that is $$d>100$$.
The first step is to identify the input and output of the equation.
The input is donuts, $$x$$, and the output is cost, c.
The initial value is the fixed cost of $$25000$$.
The rate of change is the value of change in output over change in input. We know that the rate of change is $$0.25$$ because it takes $$0.25$$ units of output to produce a single unit of input, a donut.
The equation of a linear model is $$y=mx+b$$, where $$y$$ is the output, $$x$$ is the input, $$m$$ is the rate of change, and $$b$$ is the initial value. Plug in the values we have found to obtain the final answer.
The y-intercept is the value of the output when the value of the input is $$0$$. Using the equation we derived in part a, when $$x=0$$, $$C=25000$$.

The first step is to build a linear model. For simplicity, we will define the input as years from $$2008$$, and the output as population. The initial value is $$28200$$ and the rate of change is $$\frac{36800-28200}{4-0}$$, or the change in output over the change in input.
What is $$\frac{36800-28200}{4-0}$$?
The rate of change is $$2150$$ $$\frac{people}{year}$$, so the equation is $$P(t)=2150t+28200$$, where $$t$$ is years since $$2008$$ and P(t) is the population.
$$P(t)=2150t+28200$$ when $$t$$ $$=$$ $$6$$ (since $$2014$$ is $$6$$ years after 2008), $$P(6)=$$?
Solve for $$t$$ when $$P(t)=54000$$. $$54000=2150t+28200$$, $$t=$$?
Graphing the problem is useful to understand the geometry we are working with. First, label a point T to represent the town of Timpson. We know that Ashburn is $$60$$ miles east and $$12$$ miles north of Timpson, so indicate a point A for Ashburn $$60$$ units right of Timpson and $$12$$ units up. This can be done by setting point T at the origin, $$(0,0)$$, and setting point A at $$(60,12)$$. We know that Garrison is perpendicular to the line connecting $$(0,0)$$ and $$(60,12)$$, based on the problem's given information. We can label Garrison as point G, at $$(20,0)$$ to represent being $$20$$ units east of point T. From the graph, we can tell that we are trying to find the point of the intersection between the line perpendicular to the line connecting T and A, that also goes through $$(20,0)$$.
The slope of the line between A and T is $$\frac{60}{12}=5$$.
The slope of the perpendicular line is $$\frac{-1}{5}$$. $$0=20\frac{-1}{5}+b$$, so $$b=4$$. The line is $$y=\frac{-1}{5} x+4$$.
$$\frac{-1}{5} x+4=5x$$, $$x=$$?
$$x=\frac{10}{13}$$, $$f{\left(\frac{10}{13}\right)}=$$?
$$\sqrt{{\left(\frac{50}{13}\right)}^2+{\left(\frac{10}{13}\right)}^2}=$$?
We have enough information to figure out the length of the horizontal base. We know that the parallelogram is bounded by $$x=0$$ (the $$y$$ axis) and $$x=3$$, so it is $$3$$ units wide.
(It is useful to graph the information to better understand the geometry involved.) To find the vertical dimensions, first find the equation of the line that passes through $$(2,7)$$. Then, see where it intersects the $$y$$ axis, and alsto where f(x) intersects the $$y$$ axis. Parallelograms have equal vertical bases, so the difference in the $$y$$ coordinates will be the length of the vertical base.
We know that the line passing through $$(2,7)$$ is parallel to $$f(x)=1+2x$$. What this means is that the line we want to find also has a slope of $$2$$. Since we know the slope of the line and a point on the line, we can plug this into the equation $$y=mx+b$$ to find $$b$$. We know that the point $$(2,7)$$ means $$y=7$$ and $$x=2$$, and the slope, $$m$$, is $$2$$. Thus, $$7=2\left(2\right)+b$$. Solving for $$b$$, we get that $$b=3$$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $$2x+3$$.
Next, we can find where this line intersects the $$y$$ axis. At the $$y$$ axis, $$x=0$$, so plug in $$0$$ to the equation. When $$x=0$$, $$y=2\left(0\right)+3=3$$. Thus, the coordinate point of one of the vertices is $$(0,3)$$.
We can then find where f(x) intersects the $$y$$ axis. Plugging in $$x=0$$, we get $$f(0)=1$$. Thus, the other vertice that we are looking for is $$(0,1)$$.
The difference of the $$y$$ coordinates of the two points we have found is $$3-1=3$$. Thus, the vertical base has a length of $$2$$.

The area formula for a triangle is $$\frac{1}{2} bh$$, where $$b$$ is the base and $$h$$ is the height.
First draw, a diagram. By graphing f(x) and the line perpendicular to it, we can tell that the height of the triangle is equal to the y-coordinate of the intersection between f(x) and the perpendicular line. We can also see that the horizontal base of the triangle is the distance from $$(0,0)$$ to the point where f(x) intersects the $$x$$ axis.
The first step is to figure out the equation of the perpendicular line. Because it is perpendicular to $$f(x)=12-\frac{1}{3} x$$, we know that its slope is equal to the opposite reciprocal of the slope of f(x).
What is the opposite reciprocal of $$\frac{-1}{3}$$? This is equal to the slope of the perpendicular line to f(x).
At what $$x$$ value does $$3x=12-\frac{1}{3} x$$?
When $$x=9$$, $$f(9)=$$?
Through graphing, we know that the y-coordinate of the intersection is the height of the triangle, and the intersection has coordinates $$(9,9)$$. Thus, the height of the triangle is $$9$$.
When $$y=0$$, f(x) intersects the $$x$$ axis. Plug in $$y=0$$ to the equation for f(x). What is $$x$$ equal to when $$y=0$$?
The base of the triangle is equal to the x-coordinate of the intersection between f(x) and the $$x$$ axis.

The first step is to figure out the equation of the perpendicular line. Because it is perpendicular to $$f(x)=9-\frac{6}{7} x$$, we know that its slope is equal to the opposite reciprocal of the slope of f(x).
What is the opposite reciprocal of $$\frac{-6}{7}$$? This is equal to the slope of the perpendicular line to f(x).
At what $$x$$ value does $$\frac{7}{6} x=9-\frac{6}{7} x$$?
When $$x=\frac{85}{42}$$, $$f{\left(\frac{85}{42}\right)}=$$?
Through graphing, we know that the y-coordinate of the intersection is the height of the triangle, and the intersection has coordinates $$(\frac{85}{42},\frac{356}{49})$$. Thus, the height of the triangle is $$\frac{356}{49}$$.
When $$y=0$$, f(x) intersects the $$x$$ axis. Plug in $$y=0$$ to the equation for f(x). What is $$x$$ equal to when $$y=0$$?
The base of the triangle is equal to the x-coordinate of the intersection between f(x) and the $$x$$ axis.

Consider what makes sense in terms of domain and range. Will negative $$x$$ and negative $$y$$ values make sense in this equation?
The domain, years would start at $$0$$ and would end at five. Thus, the range would be from the population at the beginning to the population five years later.
Thirty years before the start of this model, the town had no citizens. Initially, the town had a population of 75,000.
Slope is the change in output over the change in input.
In this problem, the output is population and the input is time in years.
Every unit of change for the input, which is a year, corresponds to $$2500$$ units of change for the output, which is the population. Thus, the slope is $$2500$$, and it represents the change in population over change in time.

If $$AB=I$$, where I is the identity matrix, then find the product BA. If $$BA=1$$, than $$B=A^{\left(-1\right)}$$ and $$A=B^{\left(-1\right)}$$.
We must first find the inverse of the coefficient matrix $$\begin{bmatrix} 5 & -6 \\ 4 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$. This is equal to $$\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{13} & \frac{2}{13} \\ \frac{-4}{39} & \frac{5}{39} \end{bmatrix}$$.
We must now multiply $$\begin{bmatrix} -61 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}$$ by $$\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{13} & \frac{2}{13} \\ \frac{-4}{39} & \frac{5}{39} \end{bmatrix}$$, which gives us $$\begin{bmatrix} -5 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}$$. The answer is $$(-5,6)$$

Multiplying by the identity matrix does not change the entries of the original matrix; it is like multiplying by one.

The first step in calculating Bar Widths is to find the highest number (14) and the lowest number (9).
The final step is to divide (highest - lowest)/number of bars then round up which gives us $$\frac{14-9}{6}$$ $$=$$ $$.83$$ which rounds up to $$1$$.

Since the given data set is ordered from smallest to biggest, we can just take the first number (which is the smallest). So the smallest value of this data set is $$60$$.
The smallest data value is $$60$$. Since the data with the most decimal places has one decimal (for instance, $$61.5)$$, we want our starting point to have two decimal places. Since the numbers $$0.5$$, $$0.05$$, $$0.005$$, etc. are convenient numbers, use $$0.05$$ and subtract it from $$60$$, the smallest value, for the convenient starting point.\n$$60-0.05$$ $$=$$ $$59.95$$ which is more precise than, say, $$61.5$$ by one decimal place. The starting point is, then, $$59.95$$.
Since the given data set is ordered from smallest to biggest, we can just take the last number (which is the biggest). So the smallest value of this data set is $$74$$.
Since the data with the most decimal places has one decimal, we want our ending point to have two decimal places. Since the numbers $$0.5$$, $$0.05$$, $$0.005$$, etc. are convenient numbers, use $$0.05$$ and add it to $$74$$, the smallest value, for the convenient ending point.The largest value is $$74$$, so $$74$$ + $$0.05$$ $$=$$ $$74.05$$ is the ending value.
Since the lowest data point is zero and we can not have negative number of hours, the starting point of the histogram is $$0$$. Some values in this data set fall on boundaries for the class intervals. A value is counted in a class interval if it falls on the left boundary.
The x-axis of the histogram represents the number of hours and the $$y$$ axis represents the number of students, we only need to check for the frequency of the corresponding categories. Does the histogram correctly represent the given data points?
$$10$$ is the best starting point amongst the four points. If $$16$$, $$17$$ or $$19$$ is the starting point, the data value of $$15$$ will be excluded from the histogram.
The x-axis of the histogram represents the number of employees and the $$y$$ axis represents the number of restaurants, we only need to check for the frequency of the corresponding categories. Does the histogram correctly represent the given data points?

There are two types of sampling that divide the population into groups of people: stratified and cluster. The differences between the two are that stratified sampling takes a proportionate number of subjects from each stratum to include into the sample while clustering usually means only a few clusters are selected to represent the entire population.
Does this soccer coach want to pick players from each group that he's created based on age? Or does he only want one or two groups to be represented. If the soccer coach wants people from each age group to be included in the recreational team, select stratified. If the coach only wants one or two groups to be represented, select cluster.

Note that librarian records the data for every fourth patron who checks out books.We see that this is a methodology that is not based on convenience (the librarian doesn't just pick the most easily available data points). Therefore, it must either be systematic or simple random from process of elimination. The definition of a systematic sample is randomly selecting a starting point and take the nth piece of data from the population. The definition of simple random sampling is fairly selecting a group of size $$n$$ from the population so every individual has the same chance of being selected. Which one sounds the most like the librarian's selection method?

The high school educational researcher wants to interview $$50$$ high school female teachers and $$50$$ high school male teachers. Therefore, you know that the two separate groups are high school female teachers and high school male teachers. To decide whether this is stratified or cluster sampling, we must think about whether every group is represented in the sample. Choose STRATIFIED if a proportion of each separate group is included in the final sample; choose CLUSTER if not all the groups are included in the final sample, but every member of the selected groups is included.

We see that the student interviews classmates in his algebra class. We know that this is not a simple random sample because not all students have an equal chance of being selected. Since the student doesn't have to perform much more work than just asking students in their class and is selecting students out of their proximity to them (in the same algebra class), is this a convenience sample?

The population of a study is the entire group of persons, things, or objects under which you are observing for the study. In general terms, it is the group from which you want to generalize the study results to.
What is the group of people that we're picking from to include in the study?
The sample of study is a subset of the population (essentially, a part of the population) that is actually used to conduct the sample.
What is a possible subset of the population found in the first step that we can use to include in the study?
The parameter is the numerical representation of the entire population that is estimated by a statistic. Essentially, the parameter is the data point that you desire to calculate from the entire population.
What is the parameter of the study? Essentially, what is the calculated value that you want to determine for the entire population?
The statistic is the measured value from the sample. For instance, if the parameter was to measure the average hours a student studies at a specific college, the statistic would specify the average hours a student studies in the sample that was taken to survey. An easier way to think about statistic is that it measures exactly the same thing as the parameter does, just for a subset of the population.
What is the statistic in this study? In other words, what is the calculation that we will be performing on the $$100$$ first year students at the college?
The variable, usually denoted by a capital letter, commonly X or Y, is a numerical or categorical value that can be measured for each individual in a population. Therefore, variables usually refer to the value determined for one person, subject, or object.
What is the variable in this instance? Think about what the calculated value is and what one specific person, subject, or object represents in this data set (who/what are you sampling)?
Data in a study is the values of the variables. Previously we determined that the variable in this study is the amount of money spent (excluding books) $$b$$ one first year student. What are the numerical values of this?
What are the values associated with the variable defined above? Are there examples given in the problem of students (members of the population) and how much they spent on school supplies (excluding books)?
The population of a study is the entire group of persons, things, or objects under which you are observing for the study. In general terms, it is the group from which you want to generalize the study results to.

The statistic is the measured value from the sample. It measures exactly the same thing as the parameter does, just for a subset of the population.
What is the statistic in this study? As a value that measures a sample from the population, does the statistic measure the average cumulative GPA of all students who ATTENDED the college last year, all students who GRADUATED the college last year, or students from the STUDY who graduated the college last year?
The parameter is the numerical representation of the entire population that is estimated by a statistic. Essentially, the parameter is the data point that you desire to calculate from the entire population.
What is the parameter of the study? We know from the previous step that the statistic is the average cumulative GPA of students in the study who graduated from the college last year and now we want to broaden that to the population of all the students who graduated from the college last year. Is the parameter the average cumulative GPA of students in the STUDY who graduated from the college last year, of all students who ATTENDED the college last year, or of all students who GRADUATED from the college last year?

Regard the null hypothesis like the status quo.
At the moment, the prevailing belief is that
We know that the prevailing belief is that the bread height is less than 15cm. We also know that the null hypothesis is defined similarly to the status quo or the prevailing belief, therefore the null hypothesis is that the baker's bread is less than 15cm.
The baker making the claim forms the alternate hypothesis while the customers' opinion of bread height averages forms the null hypothesis.
Given the normal distribution of means, it is indicated that the $$p-value$$ is close to $$0$$. We can interpret it as $$P\left(X>17\right)$$ is approximately zero.
A $$p-value$$ of approximately zero tells us that it is highly unlikely that a loaf of bread rises no more than $$15$$ cm, on average. That is, almost 0% of all loaves of bread would be at least as high as $$17$$ cm.
Since the outcome of 17cm is so unlikely we can conclude that the evidence is strongly against the null hypothesis (that the mean height is at most 15cm)
Is there sufficient evidence that the true mean height for the population of the baker's loaves of bread is greater than 15cm?
The results of the sample data are significant if \alpha>p-value. There is significant evidence to conclude that $$H_0$$ is an incorrect belief and that the alternative hypothesis, $$H_a$$, may be correct.

Recall what decisions must be made to decide what distribution would be best to perform hypothesis tests. When you use a normal distribution for a hypothesis test (often called a $$z-test)$$, a simple random sample is taken from the population and the population that you are working with is normally distributed or the sample size is sufficiently large.
When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population mean μ using a Student's $$t-distribution$$ (often called a $$t-test)$$, there are fundamental assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to work properly. Your data should be a simple random sample that comes from a population that is approximately normally distributed. You use the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation.
Exponential distributions involves a continuous random variable that appears when we are interested in the intervals of time between some random events. Take for example, the length of time between emergency arrivals at a hospital.
Exponential distributions cannot be used for hypothesis testing, the only eligible distributions are normal and $$t-test$$ distributions.
We can either choose normal or $$t-test$$ distribution. Although the data in this context is approximately normal and we could use normal distribution, since we are unaware of the population standard deviation, the $$t-test$$ is the best choice for this hypothesis testing scenario.

We are testing for the mean of our data, so the components of the distribution formed should be the means.
The estimate value or point estimate is a single number computed from a sample and used to estimate a population parameter.
The population parameter in this case is the population mean, therefore the point estimate of our test should be the sample mean; we are using sample means to estimate the population mean in our test.
Recall that if you are testing a single population proportion, the distribution for the test is for proportions or percentages: P'~N(p,sqrt((p*q)/n). In single population proportion testing, the estimated value is the number of successes divided by the sample size.
When conducting a hypothesis test of a single population proportion $$p$$, you must meet conditions for a binomial distribution, where the quantities $$n p$$ and $$n q$$ are greater than $$5$$. q is the complementary probably of succession $$(q=1-p)$$.
The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be a similar shape to that of the normal distribution. In order to assess similarity, we ensure the product of $$n$$ and $$p$$ and the product of $$n$$ and q are both greater than $$5$$.
In hypothesis testing of the single population proportion, we ensure all of the axioms described before are true in order to "substitute" our binomial distribution with the normal distribution because it is more convenient to use it and it is an effort to take advantage of the normal distribution's properties that can be useful for hypothesis testing.
State the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
After declaring the null and alternative hypothesis, we consider the random variable $$x$$ and the distribution it will make. First, we aren't given any information on the population standard deviation, therefore the $$t-distribution$$ should be used.

A key factor that can differentiate the viability of $$t-test$$ versus $$z-test$$ is the standard deviation. To be more exact, it must be the population standard deviation. What is the population standard deviation of student hours in hours? Round to the nearest four decimal places.
We can either choose normal or $$t-test$$ distribution. Although the data in this context is approximately normal and we could use $$t-testing$$ distribution, since we are aware of the population standard deviation, the $$t-test$$ is unnecessary and the normal distribution is the best choice for this hypothesis testing scenario.
Remember that degrees of freedom for $$t-test$$ distributions is $$n-1$$, where $$n$$ is the population

Because $$\frac{d}{dx} x^3=3x^2$$, and there might be some constant. So you need to write "+C" afterwards.
Let $$f(x)=\ln(|x|)$$. for $$x>0$$, $$f(x)=ln(x)$$ and $$\frac{d}{dx} lnx=\frac{1}{x}$$. For $$x<0$$, $$f(x)=ln(-x)$$ and $$\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{lnnegneg}\left(x\right)=\frac{-1}{-x}=\frac{1}{x}$$.
Make sure to add "+C" after your intial antiderivative to account for the unknown constant.

By the order of operation, we then proceed by adding the first two terms together. What is $$-14+\left(-28\right)$$?
We are now left with the expression $$-42-6$$. What does this evaluate to?
We start by writing out the expression in its expanded form: $${\left(-2\right)}^4=\left(-2\right) \left(-2\right) \left(-2\right) \left(-2\right)$$, and we will simplify $$\left(-2\right) \left(-2\right) \left(-2\right) \left(-2\right)$$ by performing multiplication three times.
We now multiply the first $$\left(-2\right) \left(-2\right)$$ pair together and substitute the value back into the expression. What is $$\left(-2\right) \left(-2\right)$$?
$$2\times2=4$$, and since $$-2$$ and $$-2$$ have the same signs, our final answer is positive: $$\left(-2\right) \left(-2\right)=4$$.
Substituting $$4$$ back, the orignal expression now becomes $$4\left(-2\right) \left(-2\right)$$.

$$4\times2=8$$, and since $$4$$ and $$-2$$ have different signs, our final answer is negative: $$4\left(-2\right)=-8$$.

What is $$-8\left(-2\right)$$?
$$8\times2=16$$, and since $$-8$$ and $$-2$$ have the same signs, our final answer is positive: $$-8\left(-2\right)=16$$.
We start by writing out the expression in its expanded form: $$-\left(2^4\right)=-\left(2\times2\times2\times2\right)$$, and we will simplify $$-\left(2\times2\times2\times2\right)$$ by performing multiplication four times.

Substituting $$4$$ back, the orignal expression now becomes $$-\left(4\times2\times2\right)$$.
What is $$4\times2$$?
$$4\times2=8$$, and since $$4$$ and $$2$$ have the same signs, our final answer is positive: $$4\times2=8$$.

What is $${\left(-2\right)}^3$$?
To calculate $${\left(-2\right)}^3$$, we can write it out as $$\left(-2\right) \left(-2\right) \left(-2\right)$$. We simplify it as $$\left(-2\right) \left(-2\right) \left(-2\right)=4\left(-2\right)=-8$$.
Substituting $$-8$$ back for $${\left(-2\right)}^3$$, we get the expression $$\frac{8\left(-9\right)}{\left(-8\right)}$$. We proceed by multiplying.
What is $$8\left(-9\right)$$?
Substituting $$-72$$ back for $$8\left(-9\right)$$, we get the expression $$\frac{-72}{\left(-8\right)}$$. We proceed by dividing.
What is $$\frac{-72}{\left(-8\right)}$$?
Our first step is to substitute $$-9$$ for $$y$$ into the expression, and we get the expression $$-9+8$$.
What is $$-9+8$$?
Our first step is to substitute $$-9$$ for $$y$$ into the expression, and we get the expression $$-\left(-9\right)+8$$.

What is $$-18+24$$?
Substitute $$6$$ back for $$-18+24$$, the expression now becomes $$6^2$$.
What is $$6^2$$?
$$6^2$$ is the same as $$6\times6$$, which evaluates to $$36$$.

Consider the context: a new drug is being tested, therefore the null hypothesis is that the proportion is greater or equal to assume the worst in its effectiveness.
We know that the null assumption proportion is equal to the control or greater if it is an option. The alternative claim, or attribute that is being tested is if the drug reduced the proportion of people that developed AIDS in four years since the aim is to hinder or stop AIDS development.
There is no need to calculate differences data as the sample mean and standard deviation are given.
Methods to calculate the $$p-value$$ will vary by calculator, make sure to use a $$t-test$$.
The key testing feature is that blood pressure is decreased after training. Suppose u denotes blood pressure level change, which of the following claims are correct?
Using $$x=-10.2$$, $$s=8.4$$, and $$n=6$$, the test statistic can be found through the formula test statistic $$t=\frac{x-0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$$
The computed test statistic is $$\frac{-10.2}{\frac{8.4}{\sqrt{6}}}$$, the $$p-value$$ can be found in the form P(t_5<=-10.2/(8.4/sqrt(6)))
It is found that $$P-value=0.0155$$ approximately, since the $$p-value$$ is less than $$0.05$$, our significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected and there is suffcient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that blood pressure decreased after the special exercise protocol.
When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population mean μ using a Student's $$t-distribution$$ (often called a $$t-test)$$, there are fundamental assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to work properly. Your data should be a simple random sample that comes from a population that is approximately normally distributed. You use the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation.
Recall what decisions must be made to decide what distribution would be best to perform hypothesis tests. When you use a normal distribution for a hypothesis test (often called a $$z-test)$$, a simple random sample is taken from the population and the population that you are working with is normally distributed or the sample size is sufficiently large.
Remember that degrees of freedom for $$t-test$$ distributions is $$n-1$$, where $$n$$ is the population. $$n$$ is $$6$$ in this case.
Calculate the differences between the corresponding players when weight was lifted prior and after the class to get an ordered list of differences.
What is the calculated difference of Player 1?
The difference of Player 1's weight prior and after the class is can be found by subtracting $$295$$ and $$205$$. Do the same for the rest of the set of players.
You may use the new list of differences to find the mean differences by adding all the terms and dividing by the number of terms in the list. You may alternatively put the differences data on a table on your graphing calculator to find the sample mean.

The choices provided are really similar. It is best to choose the random variable that best represents our sample. In this case, the maximum weight lifted difference per player is the random variable.
If the level of significance is 5%, the decision is not to reject the null hypothesis, because the significance value $$0.05<p-value$$, therefore, given our sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the strength development class helped to make the players stronger, on average.
Recall that the $$p-value$$ is the probability that an event will happen purely by chance assuming the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the $$p-value$$, the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis.
The level of significance in this instance is $$0.05$$. Our $$p-value$$ is less than that boundary value, therefore there is statistical significance of a lower proportion of patients that developed AIDS in four years when taking the new drug compared to the control group.
Input the differences data into a calculator to obtain the mean differences and standard deviation to get the test statistic.
This is a paired $$t-test$$ as the before and after data is provided as we are testing the mean difference between pairs of measurements if they are zero or not.
The test statistic can be found through the formula test statistic $$t=\frac{x-0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$$.
The probability of obtaining our test statistic is $$0.841$$, and the test statistic obtained is $$-1.19$$, what is the $$p-value$$?
Since $$0.841>0.05$$, the null hypothesis is rejected and there is sufficient evidence that the new technique taught by the golf instructor can improve golf players' scores.
For the TI-83+ and TI-84 calculators, you can either calculate the differences ahead of time (after - before) and put the differences into a list or you can put the after data into a first list and the before data into a second list. Then go to a third list and arrow up to the name. Enter 1st list name - 2nd list name. The calculator will do the subtraction, and you will have the differences in the third list.

We are testing if the measurements, on average, are lower after hypnotism.
We can now start formulating the claims. We have before and after data and have a null assumption that there is a mean zero difference between the data, therefore we are conducting a paired two sample test.
We must assume that there are no effects post hypnotism. Let $$\mu_d$$ denote the difference in before and after pain measurements.
Let $$μ_d$$ denote the difference in pain measurements.
Which of the following claim pairs matches the situation described?
We must assume that the treatment offered is worse for pain or has no effect, therefore the mean differences in pain measurements by default is greater than or equal to zero.

test statistic $$t=x_d-\mu_d/(s_d/sqrt(n))$$, $$otherwise$$ $$known$$ $$as$$ $$the$$ $$quantity$$ $$mean$$ $$sample$$ $$difference$$ $$subtracted$$ $$by$$ $$the$$ $$population$$ $$mean$$ $$for$$ $$the$$ $$differences$$ $$divided$$ $$by$$ $$the$$ $$sample$$ $$standard$$ $$deviation$$ $$divided$$ $$by$$ $$the$$ $$square$$ $$root$$ $$of$$ $$n$$. $$Note$$ $$that$$ $$this$$ $$is$$ $$a$$ $$t$$ $$distribution$$ $$with$$ $$degrees$$ $$of$$ $$freedom$$ $$n-1$$.
We must know the mean ($$\bar x_d$$) and standard deviation differences($$s_d$$). Using a graphing calculator, the mean differences and the standard deviation of differences can be found in the STAT menu. The mean difference is found to be $$3.125$$.
With mean difference equalling $$3.125$$, $$s_d$$=2.91143 $$(the$$ $$standard$$ $$deviation$$ $$of$$ $$differences)$$, $$and$$ $$n=8$$, $$test$$ $$statistic$$ $$t=3.03591$$. $$Round$$ $$to$$ $$four$$ $$decimal$$ $$places$$
Under the P-value table associated with $$t=3.0359$$ and degrees of freedom equaling $$8+8-2=14$$, the $$p-value$$ is found to be $$0.00948$$.
Since $$0.00948$$, the $$p-value$$, is less than our significance level of $$0.05$$, the result is significant and we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference.
First, use implicit differentiation to find $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$. Differentiate both sides of the equation, then simplify.
$$\frac{dy}{dx}$$ is $$\frac{-y {sec}^2 x y}{x {sec}^2 x y-1}$$
To find the slope, plug $$(\frac{\pi}{4},1)$$ into $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$.
Substitute into the point-slope equation of the line to obtain the equation.
Use implicit differentiation to find $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$. Differentiate both sides of the equation, then simplify.

The first step is to pick two equations and solve for one variable.
The next step is to pick another pair of equations and solve for the same variable
Using the resulting equations, sovle the system of two equations to find the values of those variables.
Back-substitute the known variables into any one of the original equations and solve for the missing variable.
We must plug in the values $$x=3, y=-2$$, and $$z=1$$ into the system of equations.\n$$3-2+1=2$$. This is true.\n6(3)-4(-2)+5(1)=31. This is also true.\n5(3)+2(-2)+2(1)=13. This is also true. This meaens that the ordered pair is a solution and the answer is 'y'.
We can eliminate $$x$$ to add the first two equations to get $$y+2z=3$$. We must however, find another equation without $$x$$ in it. To do this, we must multiply equation $$1$$ by $$-2$$ and add the result to equation $$3$$. This will result in the equation $$-y-z=-1$$.
We can solve for $$z$$ by adding the two equations derived in the previous step: $$y+2z=3$$ and $$-y-z=-1$$. The sum is $$z=2$$. We can now back-substitute $$z$$ into $$y+2z=3$$ to get $$y=-1$$. Finally, this can all be plugged back into equation $$1$$ to yield the solution for $$x$$. $$x+2+6=9$$, $$x=1$$.
To solve this problem, we use all of the information given and set up three equations. First, we assign a variable to each of the three investment amounts: $$x=money_{market}$$ fund, $$y=municipal$$ bonds, $$z=mutual$$ funds. With these variables, we can create the three following equations based on the information given in the word problem: x+y+z=12000,z=y+4000,0.03x+0.04y+0.07z=670. These three equations make a system. To make the caculations easier, the last equation can be multipled by $$100$$, giving us $$3x+4y+7z=67000$$
To solve this equation, we must first multiply equation $$1$$ by $$-3$$, giving us $$y+4z=31000$$. We can now add equation $$2$$ to that derived in the eprevious step to give us $$5z=35000$$, $$z=7000$$. With $$z$$, we can solve for y: we plug back in to equation $$2$$ and solve for $$y$$. $$-y+7000=4000, y=3000$$. Finally, we plug $$z$$ and $$y$$ into equation $$1$$ to get $$x+3000+7000=12000$$, leading to $$x=2000$$. Thus, we have the soluttion nas (2000,3000,7000)
We can multiply equation $$3$$ by $$-3$$ and add to the second equation to get $$3y=10z=-13$$. This eliminates the $$x-variablee$$ in one equation, but we must do it in another as well. So, we can multiply equation $$3$$ by $$-2$$ and add to the third equation to get $$5y-8z=-13$$
With the equations derived in the previous steps, we can solve for $$z$$. We can multiply $$5y-8z=-13$$ by $$\frac{-5}{3}$$ and add to $$3y-10z=-13$$ to get $$z=1$$. This can be substituted back into $$5y-8z=-13$$ to get $$y=-1$$. All this can be substituted into the first equation to get $$x=1$$.
We can eliminate $$x$$ by adding equation $$1$$ to equation $$2$$ to get $$-y-4z=7$$. We can then multiply equation $$1$$ by $$-5$$ and add to equation $$3$$ to get $$2y+8z=-12$$.
Equation $$4$$ can be multiplied by $$2$$ and added to equation $$5$$ to try and solve for $$z$$. However, this leads to both variables $$z$$ and $$y$$ to be cancelled out, leading to the equation $$0=2$$. Since this is false, the system is inconsistent.
To eliminate $$x$$, multiply the first equation by $$-2$$ and add the result to the third equation. We get $$-y+3z=-4$$. If we add this to the second equation, we get $$0=-3$$, which is false. So, the system is inconsistent.
First, we can multiply equation $$1$$ by $$-2$$ and add it to equation $$2$$, but this gives us $$0=0$$ which is always true. S
This means that we must find the general solution, or the solution in terms of $$x$$. Add equations $$1$$ and $$2$$ to get $$3x-2z=0$$. $$z=\frac{3}{2} x$$. Back-substitute the expressionn for $$z$$ and solve for $$y$$. $$2x+y-\frac{9}{2} x=0, y=\frac{5}{2} x$$. So, the solution is (x,5/2x,3/2x)
Multiply the first equation by $$-3$$ and add the result to the second equation. This gives us $$-5y-4z=-17$$. Now, multiply thee first equation by $$-1$$ and add to the third equation to get $$5y+4z=17$$. Add these two equations together to get $$0=0$$. This system is dependent.
Solve for $$y$$ in the equation $$5y+4z-17$$ to get $$y=\frac{-4}{5} t+\frac{17}{5}$$. Substitute this into the first equation to find $$x$$. $$x+\left(-\frac{4}{5} z+\frac{17}{5}\right)+z=7, x=\frac{-1}{5} z+\frac{18}{5}$$. The solution is (-1/5z+18/5,-4/5z+17/5,z)
Multiply all $$3$$ equations by $$2$$ to remove the fraction. Then rearrange the equation so all variables are on one side and constants on the other.

Use the Quotient Property of Logarithms: $$\log_{a}\left(\frac{M}{N}\right)$$ $$=$$ $$\log_{a}\left(M\right)$$ - $$\log_{a}\left(N\right)$$.
In this case, $$\log_{10}\left(\frac{10}{y}\right)$$ $$=$$ $$\log_{10}\left(10\right)$$ - $$\log_{10}\left(y\right)$$.

In this case, $$\log_{10}\left(x^{20}\right)$$ $$=$$ $$20*\log_{10}\left(x\right)$$.
Use the Product Property first: $$\log_{a}\left(M N\right)$$ $$=$$ $$\log_{a}\left(M\right)$$ + $$\log_{a}\left(N\right)$$.
Here, the Product Property gives $$\log_{4}\left(2\right)$$ + $$\log_{4}\left(x^3\right)$$ + $$\log_{4}\left(y^2\right)$$.

Here, the Power Property on $$\log_{4}\left(x^3\right)$$ + $$\log_{4}\left(y^2\right)$$ gives $$3*\log_{4}\left(x\right)$$ + $$2*\log_{4}\left(y\right)$$
Simplify the elements that you can. Here, $$\log_{4}\left(2\right)$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{1}{2}$$.
The previous steps leave the equation $$1/2+3*\log_{4}\left(x\right)+2*\log_{4}\left(y\right)$$.
Use the property $$\log_{a}\left(a\right)$$ $$=$$ $$1$$. Thus, $$\log_{9}\left(9\right)$$ $$=$$ $$1$$.

A stem-and-leaf graph (also known as a stemplot) is used for exploratory data analysis. On the "leaf" side of the table, we will list out the final significant digit (the last digit important to the data set). All other digits go in the "stem" side of the table. For instance, $$23$$ has stem $$2$$ and leaf 3; $$5432$$ has stem $$543$$ and leaf 2; $$9.3$$ has stem $$9$$ and leaf $$3$$.
Which two stem-and-leaf graphs include all the stems required for this question?
All data points will be visible in the stem-and-leaf graph, even duplicates. For instance, if $$94$$ appears twice in the given data set, it will appear twice in the stem-and-leaf graph as well.
Which graph includes all the correct data values for the given data?
Which graph includes all the duplicates? For instance, $$49$$, $$55$$, $$68$$, and $$69$$ should appear twice in the graph while $$88$$ should appear three times and $$94$$ four times.
Bar graphs show different bars that are separated from one another, separating categorical data into their categories. The bars are rectangles that can be horizontal or vertical.
Since we're using vertical bars, our horizontal axis will list out the categories. Are the categories the ages or the proportions? Think about how we're separating the data into different groups. What are those groups?
Knowing that the categories are ages, which graph can we EXCLUDE?

A stem-and-leaf graph (also known as a stemplot) is used for exploratory data analysis. On the "leaf" side of the table, we will list out the final significant digit (the last digit important to the data set). All other digits go in the "stem" side of the table. For instance, $$23$$ has stem $$2$$ and leaf 3; $$5432$$ has stem $$543$$ and leaf 2; $$9.3$$ has stem $$9$$ and leaf $$3$$.
Now, think about what it means for a student to get a score in the 90s or $$100$$. What would be the correct stems to look at from the graph?
Each leaf represents one data point in the chart. For instance, since there are four leaves labeled $$4$$ in the $$9$$ stem, we know that four people got 94s on the exam.
How many data points are there total in the $$9$$ and $$10$$ stems?
The definition of a proportion is a part of the whole. Knowing that the part we're specifying is $$8$$, we can now determine the size of the whole.
How many data points are there in total?
What is the part divided by the whole? In essence, what is the number of students who got an A (90 and above) over all the students in the data set?
We know that $$8$$ people score $$90$$ or above, and there are $$31$$ people total. Therefore, the proportion is $$\frac{8}{31}$$.
A stem-and-leaf graph (also known as a stemplot) is used for exploratory data analysis. On the "leaf" side of the table, we will list out the final significant digit (the last digit important to the data set). All other digits go in the "stem" side of the table.

Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed.
The statistical value could be variance or standard deviation. Let the variance of instructors $$1$$ and $$2$$ equal $$\sigma_1 $$and$$ $$\sigma_2 $$respectively$$. $$The$$ $$instructors$$ $$are$$ $$concerned$$ $$with$$ $$variation$$ $$of$$ $$test$$ $$results$$, $$therefore$$ $$a$$ $$test$$ $$of$$ $$two$$ $$variances$$ $$will$$ $$be$$ $$performed$$.
Test the claim that the first instructor's variance is smaller is a key indicator of the alternative hypothesis.
By default, the variances are expected to be the same among college instructors, so let that be the null hypothesis.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same, the F statistic is $$\frac{{s_1}^2}{{s_2}^2}$$, where s would denote the sample variance.
Instructor 1's variance is $$52.3$$, and instructor 2's variance is $$89.9$$. divide instructor 1's variance with instructor 2's variance.
$$F=\frac{52.3}{89.9}$$
Since the alternative claim is that instructor 1's grade variances are less than that of instructor $$2$$, the test will be left tailed.
In a hypothesis test, a $$p-value$$ lower than the significance level means that the null hypothesis is rejected. With a 10% of significance converted to $$0.10$$, the significance level is higher than the $$p-value$$ of $$0.0753$$.
The bikers are interested in whether or not the variances are the same. This indicates that a two tailed test is being performed.
Variances will be compared. Variances are squares of the standard deviation.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same, let s denote the standard deviations. The F statistic is $$\frac{{s_1}^2}{{s_2}^2}$$.
Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let $$\sigma**{2}_{1} $$and$$ $$\sigma**{2}_{2} $$be$$ $$the$$ $$population$$ $$variances$$ $$and$$ $$s**{2}_{1} $$and$$ $$s**{2}_{1} $$be$$ $$the$$ $$sample$$ $$variances$$. $$Let$$ $$the$$ $$sample$$ $$sizes$$ $$be$$ $$n_1$$ $$and$$. $$_2$$. $$Since$$ $$we$$ $$are$$ $$interested$$ $$in$$ $$comparing$$ $$the$$ $$two$$ $$sample$$ $$variances$$, $$we$$ $$use$$ $$the$$ $$F$$ $$ratio$$: $$F$$ $$=$$ \dfrac{\left[\dfrac{(s_{1})**{2}}{(\sigma_{1})**{2}}\right]}{\left[\dfrac{(s_{2})**{2}}{(\sigma_{2})**{2}}\right]}
Given the variances, we can take the square root of each of them to find the standard deviation, and thereafterwards divide them by each other to get our F statistic.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same. Let s denote the standard deviations. The F statistic is $$\frac{{s_1}^2}{{s_2}^2}$$.
By $$\frac{{38.1}^2}{{22.5}^2}$$, the F statistic is $$2.8674$$
Student 1's standard deviation is $$38.1$$, and student 2's standard deviation is $$22.5$$. Divide student 1's variance with student 2's variance.
Let the variance of students $$1$$ and $$2$$ equal $$\sigma_1 $$and$$ $$\sigma_2 $$respectively$$. $$The$$ $$students$$ $$are$$ $$concerned$$ $$with$$ $$variation$$ $$of$$ $$grade$$ $$results$$, $$therefore$$ $$a$$ $$test$$ $$of$$ $$two$$ $$variances$$ $$will$$ $$be$$ $$performed$$.
If the second student thinks that he is more consistent, then that signals that his variance in grades is smaller than the first student. Let that claim be the alternative hypothesis.
The students are interested if there is variation between their grades or not, therefore the null hypothesis is that their variations are the same approximately.
Let T1 $$=$$ tenor $$1$$, and B2 $$=$$ bass $$2$$. The standard deviations of the samples are $$s_{T1}=3.3302$$ and $$s_{B2}=2.7208$$ after inputting the data into separate groups of Bass and Tenor men.
Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed.
By default, the height variances are equal to each other, and the challenging statement that motivates the test is that the variance of heights go up with lower voices. It's hard to form an alternative hypothesis inequality statement off of this, so formulate the hypotheses based off of the base question if the variance of the heights of the singers of the two groups are different from each other.
State the null and alternative hypotheses. Let $$\sigma**{2}_{\text{T1}} $$denote$$ $$Tenor$$ $$1$$ $$singers$$ $$and$$ $$\sigma**{2}_{\text{B2}} $$denote$$ $$Bass$$ $$2$$ $$players$$.
If the key motivation behind the test is finding a difference in variances, then the alternative hypothesis is that the variances of the two groups concerned aren't equal to each other.
What is the F statistic? Round to four decimal places/
Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let $$\sigma**{2}_{1} $$and$$ $$\sigma**{2}_{2} $$be$$ $$the$$ $$population$$ $$variances$$ $$and$$ $$s**{2}_{1} $$and$$ $$s**{2}_{1} $$be$$ $$the$$ $$sample$$ $$variances$$. $$Let$$ $$the$$ $$sample$$ $$sizes$$ $$be$$ $$n_1$$ $$and$$. $$_2$$. $$Since$$ $$we$$ $$are$$ $$interested$$ $$in$$ $$comparing$$ $$the$$ $$two$$ $$sample$$ $$variances$$, $$we$$ $$use$$ $$the$$ $$F$$ $$ratio$$: $$F$$ $$=$$ \dfrac{\left[\dfrac{(s_{1})**{2}}{(\sigma_{1})**{2}}\right]}{\left[\dfrac{(s_{2})**{2}}{(\sigma_{2})**{2}}\right]}
Calculate the F statistic by squaring each of the standard deviations and dividing the tenor group by the bass group squared standard deviations. Remember to round to four decimal places.
The F statistic is $$1.4894$$ with $$20$$ and $$25$$ degrees of freedom for Tenor $$1$$ and Bass $$2$$ respectively.
Another of the uses of the F distribution is testing two variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages. For instance, college administrators would like two college professors grading exams to have the same variation in their grading. In order for a lid to fit a container, the variation in the lid and the container should be the same. A supermarket might be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers.
In order to perform a F test of two variances, since the test in equality is very sensitive to deviation compared to other tests used, the populations must be consistent.
Since a test in two variances is very sensitive to deviations from normality, what would be a good assumption to make?
If the test is sensitive to deviations from normality, then the two populations being tested from which the two samples will be drawn should be normally distributed.
Another of the uses of the F distribution is testing two variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages. For instance, college administrators would like two college professors grading exams to have the same variation in their grading. In order for a lid to fit a container, the variation in the lid and the container should be the same. A supermarket might be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers.
When performing a test of two variances (or frankly most tests), we don't want our results to be affected by any other confounding variables.
Since we don't want to get our results messed up by external factors or data relation to each other, what would be a good assumption to ensure an efficient test of two variances?
Given the options listed, the best way to reduce confounding factors is to ensure that the two populations are independent of each other so that misleading correlations are avoided.
Let the variance of workers $$1$$ and $$2$$ equal $$\sigma_1 $$and$$ $$\sigma_2 $$respectively$$. $$The$$ $$workers$$ $$are$$ $$concerned$$ $$with$$ $$variation$$ $$of$$ $$commute$$ $$times$$, $$therefore$$ $$a$$ $$test$$ $$of$$ $$two$$ $$variances$$ $$will$$ $$be$$ $$performed$$.
If the first worker thinks that he is more consistent, then that signals that his variance in time to commute to work is smaller than the second worker. Let that claim be the alternative hypothesis.
By default, since the workers commute at the same place in the same distances, the variances will be equal to each other.
Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed.
We are given the sample variances. The variances are the standard deviations squared.
With the variance of worker $$1$$ being $$12.1$$, the sample standard deviation would be the square root of $$12.1$$.
We are given the sample variances. The variances are the standard deviations squared.
With the variance of worker $$2$$ being $$16.9$$, the sample standard deviation would be the square root of $$16.9$$.
$$n$$ is the sample size.
In this test of two variances, $$n$$ is expressed as the populations of each of the samples. The workers happened to have the same $$n$$ commutes in our case.
By the null hypothesis that the variances are the same, the F statistic is $$\frac{{s_1}^2}{{s_2}^2}$$, where s would denote the sample variance.
Worker 1's variance is $$12.1$$, and worker 2's variance is $$16.9$$. divide worker 1's variance with worker 2's variance.

Remember that the IQR is the formula Quartile $$3$$ - Quartile $$1$$. Therefore, to determine the quartiles, we'll first determine the median.
What is the median of the data set?
The definition for Quartile $$1$$ is the middle value of the lower half of the data. The definition for Quartile $$3$$ is the middle value for the upper half of the data. Remember that the halfpoint of the data is determined by the median, so we now need to find the middle points of the remaining data.

A low percentile for speed means that the runner has a slower speed through the race while a high percentile for speed means that the runner has a faster speed throughout the race.
In context, since this is a race, is it better to have a lower percentile (finishing slower due to slower speed) or have a higher percentile (finishing faster due to faster speed)?
The percentage of data values that are less than or equal to the 40th percentile is 40%.
Based on this, since the 40th percentile for speed in a particular race is $$7.5$$ miles per hour, does that equate to 40% of runners finishing the race with a speed of $$7.5$$ miles per hour or less OR $$7.5$$ miles per hour or more?
The percentage of data values that are less than or equal to the 85th percentile is 85%.
Based on this, since the 85th percentile for time spend waiting at the DMV is $$32$$ minutes, does that equate to 85% of people waiting at the DMV for $$32$$ minutes or less OR $$32$$ minutes or more?
A low percentile for wait time means that the person has to wait less minutes at the DMV, which means spending less time of their day in a line while a high percentile for wait time means the person has to wait more minutes at the DMV, which means spending more time of their day in a line. Assume this person is busy and does not like standing in line.
In context, since this person is busy, is it better to have a lower percentile (shorter wait times) or have a higher percentile (longer wait times)?
First order the data from smallest to largest. Here is the ordering: $28,000; $33,000; $40,500; $42,000; $54,000; $54,000; $64,500; $68,500; $69,000; $72,000; $120,000.
Remember that the IQR is the formula Quartile $$3$$ - Quartile $$1$$. Therefore, to determine the quartiles, we'll first determine the median.
What is the median of the data set?
The definition for Quartile $$1$$ is the middle value of the lower half of the data. The definition for Quartile $$3$$ is the middle value for the upper half of the data. Remember that the halfpoint of the data is determined by the median, so we now need to find the middle points of the remaining data.
What is Quartile 1? What is the middle value of the lower half of the data?
What is Quartile 3? What is the middle value of the upper half of the data?
The definition of IQR (interquartile range) is the number that indicates the spread of the middle half or the middle 50% of the data. It is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile.
What is the IQR?
The IQR can help to determine potential outliers. A value is a potential outlier if it is less than $$(1.5)(IQR)$$ below the first quartile or more than $$(1.5)(IQR)$$ above the third quartile.
What is $$(1.5)(IQR)$$?
What is Quartile $$1-(1.5)(IQR)$$?
What is Quartile $$3+1.5IQR$$?
Are there any values in the data set that are less than $$(1.5)(IQR)$$ below the first quartile?
Are there any values in the data set that are greater than $$(1.5)(IQR)$$ above the third quartile?
What is the potential outlier that is greater than $$(1.5)(IQR)$$ above Quartile 3?
The percentage of data values that are less than or equal to the 34th percentile is 34%.
Based on this, since the 34th percentile of housing prices in the town you want to move to is $240,000, does that equate to 34% of housing prices to be $240,000 or less OR $240,000 or more?
Note that in the "cumulative relative frequency" column we see the value $$0.52$$. The median is the 50th percentile or the second quartile. Therefore, we can count of the "frequency" column and find the midpoint.
There are $$50$$ total data points. How many data points will be less than the median?
Where is the 25th data point based on frequency?
Because there are an even number of total data points, we note that there will be $$\frac{50}{2}=25$$ data points below the median and $$\frac{50}{2}=25$$ data points above the median. Therefore, the median will be the middle point between the 25th and 26th data points.
What is the 25th data point?
What is the 26th data point?
What is the middle point between the 25th and 26th data points?
Note that the 90th percentile will be the data point (90% of 50)th data point.
What is $$0.90(50)$$?
Therefore, the 90th percentile will reside between the 45th and 46th data points in this data set.
What is the 45th data point? Look at the frequency column (sums up to 50) and determine which amount of sleep the 45th data point resides in.
This means that the $$9$$ "hours per school night" amount houses values from the Xth value to the 47th value. We note that there are $$7$$ total items in the $$9$$ "hours per school night" bin. What is X?

What is the value of the 45th data point?
Is $$46$$ greater than $$41$$ and less than 48?
What is the value of the 46th data point?
What is the average of the 45th and 46th data point?
For a Box-and-Whisker Plot, we note that there are two boxes and two whiskers (two lines extending from the boxes). The boxes represent the quartiles: the first box goes from the first quartile to the second quartile and the second box goes from the second quartile to the third quartile. The whiskers represent the remaining data (the 25% of the data that is less than the first quartile and the 25% of the data greater than the third quartile).
As children are defined as age $$17$$ and under while senior citizens are age $$65$$ and over, are children and seniors represented as boxes or whiskers?
How much data does each of the whiskers represent?
Is the length of the whisker on the left shorter or the length of the whisker on the right shorter?
Does the left whisker (age $$17$$ and under) include other age groups except children?
What percentage of the U.S. population is children?
Does the right whisker (age $$50$$ and older) include other age groups except seniors?
What percentage of the U.S. population is seniors?
If there are other people also part of the whisker, which contains 25% of the data point, this means that the population of seniors does not take up the entire whisker. If a whisker contains 25% of the data, does this mean that seniors make up 25% of the data, <25% of the data, or >25% of the data?
Are there fewer or more children than senior citizens?
Is "25%" > "less than 25%"?
The complement rule essentially explains that the proportion of the survey that answered "not sure" is equivalent to $$1$$ (or 100%) minus the sum of all the relative frequencies of those who answered in the table. Essentially, the proportion that answered "not sure" should be $$1$$ minus the sum of all the relative frequencies of those who answered <20,000; $$20, 000-25, 000;$$ $$25, 000-30, 000;$$ $$30, 000-40, 000;$$ $$40, 000-50, 000;$$ $$50, 000-75, 000;$$ $$75, 000-99, 999;$$ and 100,000+.
What is the sum of the relative frequencies for those who responded <20,000; $$20, 000-25, 000;$$ $$25, 000-30, 000;$$ $$30, 000-40, 000;$$ $$40, 000-50, 000;$$ $$50, 000-75, 000;$$ $$75, 000-99, 999;$$ or 100,000+?
What is $$1$$ minus the sum of the relative frequencies?
What is $$1-0.94$$?
The proportion that think that middle-class is from $25,000 to $50,000 is just the sum of the relative frequencies of the columns that include that range.
Which columns include the full range 20,000 to 50,000? Remember that for each row, we only include the left endpoint and not the right (so $$20, 000-25, 000$$ includes 20,000 but doesn't include 25,000).
What is the sum of the relative frequencies of the columns you determined?
Remember the formula for finding the kth Percentile. We want to know three values: $$k=the$$ kth percentile, usually given to you; $$i=the$$ index (ranking or position of the data value), what we normally want to find; $$n=the$$ total number of data. Then, we can use the formula to calculate $$i=\frac{k}{100} \left(n+1\right)$$. If i is an integer, we use the data at the ith position in the ordered data. If i is not an integer, we then round i down and up to the nearest integers and take the average of these two.

Using the distributive law, we can change $${\left(128x^6+128\right)}^{\frac{4}{7}}$$ to $${128}^{\frac{4}{7}} {\left(x^6+1\right)}^{\frac{4}{7}}$$.
$$128=2^7$$, so $${128}^{\frac{4}{7}} {\left(x^6+1\right)}^{\frac{4}{7}}$$ is equivalent to $${\left(2^7\right)}^{{\left(\frac{1}{7}\right)}^4} {\left(x^6+1\right)}^{\frac{4}{7}}$$.

$$a=\frac{a b}{b}$$, so $$\frac{30}{x^2-9}+2=\frac{30}{x^2-9}+\frac{2\left(x^2-9\right)}{x^2-9}$$
$$\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}=\frac{a+b}{c}$$, so $$\frac{30}{x^2-9}+\frac{2\left(x^2-9\right)}{x^2-9}=\frac{30+2\left(x^2-9\right)}{x^2-9}$$
What is $$30+2\left(x^2-9\right)$$?

$$RHS=\frac{5x+15}{x^2-9}$$
For $$x \neq \pm 3$$, $$\frac{2x^2+12}{x^2-9}=\frac{5x+15}{x^2-9}$$ means that $$2x^2+12=5x+15$$, which is $$2x^2-5x-3=0$$.
To solve $$2x^2-5x-3=0$$, use the formula $$x=\frac{\left(-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4a c}\right)}{2a}$$ where $$a=2$$, $$b=-5$$, $$c=-3$$.
What is $$x$$ after solving the equation?
Can we choose $$x=3$$?

$$\sqrt[3]{x-3} \neq 0$$, so $$x \neq 3$$
Using distributive law for LHS numerator, $${\left(2x-6\right)}^2=2^2 {\left(x-3\right)}^2$$
Convert radicals to exponents for LHS denominator using the fact that $$\sqrt[n]{y}=y^{\frac{1}{n}}$$, so $$\sqrt[3]{x-3}={\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{1}{3}}$$
We have $$\frac{2^2 {\left(x-3\right)}^2}{{\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{1}{3}}}$$, which is equivalent to $$2^2 \frac{{\left(x-3\right)}^2}{{\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{1}{3}}}$$.
$$\frac{a^b}{a^c}=a^{b-c}$$
Which option is equivalent to $$2^2 \frac{{\left(x-3\right)}^2}{{\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{1}{3}}}$$?
$$2^a=4096$$. What is the value of a?
We have $$2^2 {\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{5}{3}}=2^{12}$$. Divide both sides by $$2^2$$, we get $${\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{5}{3}}=2^{10}$$
To transform $${\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{5}{3}}$$ to $$x-3$$, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power of $$\frac{3}{5}$$ to get $${\left({\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{5}{3}}\right)}^{\frac{3}{5}}={\left(2^{10}\right)}^{\frac{3}{5}}$$, which can be simplified to $$(x-3)=2^6$$.
Since $${\left(a^b\right)}^c=a^{b c}$$, $${\left({\left(x-3\right)}^{\frac{5}{3}}\right)}^{\frac{3}{5}}=\frac{{\left(2^{10}\right)}^3}{5}$$ can be simplified to $$(x-3)=2^6$$.
What is $$2^6$$?
$$x-3=64$$. What is $$x$$?
$$a^{b+c}=a^b a^c$$, so $$3^{2x+2}=3^2 3^{2x}$$
$$a^{b c}={\left(a^b\right)}^c$$, so $$3^{2x}={\left(3^2\right)}^x=9^x$$
Therefore, $$3^{2x+2}$$ + $$9^x=3^2 3^{2x}+9^x=9{\left(3^2\right)}^x+9x=9\times9^x+9^x=\left(9+1\right) 9^x=10\times9^x$$.
$${81}^x={\left(9^2\right)}^x=9^{2x}$$
$$10\times9^x=9^{2x}$$
If a, $$b$$, $$c>0$$, $$a=b$$ implies $$\log_{c}\left(a\right)=\log_{c}\left(b\right)$$.
Can $$10\times9^x=9^{2x}$$ imply $$\log_{9}\left(10\times9^x\right)=\log_{9}\left(9^{2x}\right)$$?
$$\log_{c}\left(a b\right)=\log_{c}\left(a\right)+\log_{c}\left(b\right)$$
Is $$\log_{9}\left(10\times9^x\right)$$ equivalent to $$\log_{9}\left(10\right)+\log_{9}\left(9^x\right)$$?
$$\log_{b}\left(b^a\right)=a$$
Therefore, $$\log_{9}\left(9^x\right)=x$$, $$\log_{9}\left(9^{2x}\right)=2x$$.
$$\log_{9}\left(10\right)+x=2x$$. What is $$x$$?
Since the denominator cannot be $$0$$, $$2x$$ cannot be $$0$$, which implies $$x$$ cannot be $$0$$
To remove the denominator, we can multiply $$2x$$ on both sides of the equation.

To remove the square root for the equation $$\sqrt{7x^2+1}=-4x$$, we can square on both sides.
What is $${\sqrt{7x^2+1}}^2={\left(-4x\right)}^2$$?
$$7x^2+1=16x^2$$ is equivalent to $$9x^2=1$$, so $$x^2=\frac{1}{9}$$
Solve $$x^2=\frac{1}{9}$$. Which option is correct for the value of $$x$$?
Since $$x<0$$, what is $$x$$?
Since $$x<1$$, then $$x-1<0$$.
What does $$|x-1|$$ equal to in this case?
Now we have $$\frac{{\left(1-x\right)}^3}{\sqrt{1-x}}$$, which is equivalent to $$\frac{{\left(1-x\right)}^3}{{\left(1-x\right)}^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$ after converting radicals to exponents.
Since $$\frac{a^b}{a^c}=a^{b-c}$$, $$\frac{{\left(1-x\right)}^3}{{\left(1-x\right)}^{\frac{1}{2}}}={\left(1-x\right)}^{3-\frac{1}{2}}={\left(1-x\right)}^{\frac{5}{2}}$$.
For our simplified expression $${\left(1-x\right)}^{\frac{5}{2}}$$, what are values of A and R respectively?
By the hint, we know $$x-1>0$$, so $$x>1$$, and $$x^3-3x-10>0$$
$$b*(\log_{c}\left(a\right))=\log_{c}\left(a^b\right)$$, so $$\log_{7}\left(49\right)+3*(\log_{7}\left(x-1\right))-\log_{7}\left(x^3-3x-10\right)=\log_{7}\left(49\right)+\log_{7}\left({\left(x-1\right)}^3\right)-\log_{7}\left(x^3-3x-10\right)$$
Since $$\log_{c}\left(a b\right)=\log_{c}\left(a\right)+\log_{c}\left(b\right)$$ and $$\log_{c}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)=\log_{c}\left(a\right)-\log_{c}\left(b\right)$$, so $$\log_{7}\left(49\right)+\log_{7}\left({\left(x-1\right)}^3\right)-\log_{7}\left(x^3-3x-10\right)=\log_{7}\left(\frac{49{\left(x-1\right)}^3}{x^3-3x-10}\right)$$
For $$a>0$$, $$\log_{c}\left(a\right)=b$$ implies $$a=c^b$$
$$\log_{7}\left(\frac{49{\left(x-1\right)}^3}{x^3-3x-10}\right)=2$$ is equivalent to $$\frac{49{\left(x-1\right)}^3}{x^3-3x-10}=7^2=49$$
Divide by $$49$$ on both sides, we get $$\frac{{\left(x-1\right)}^3}{x^3-3x-10}=1$$
Since we've showed $$x^3-3x-10>0$$, which one is equivalent to $$\frac{{\left(x-1\right)}^3}{x^3-3x-10}=1$$?
Which one is equivalent to $${\left(x-1\right)}^3$$?
$$x^3-3x^2+3x-1=x^3-3x-10$$, so $$3x^2-6x-9=0$$
Divide by $$3$$ on both sides, we get $$x^2-2x-3=0$$
$$x^2-2x-3$$ is equivalent to which option?
$$\left(x-3\right) \left(x+1\right)=0$$, so $$x=3$$ or $$-1$$.
Since $$x>1$$, what can $$x$$ be?

When examine the graph, it is clear that majority of the points are close to a linear line with equation $$y=\frac{7}{9}$$ $$x$$


Linear Regression is the process of finding the line that best fits the data on the plot.
The number to the second power is always a positive numebr.
If $$r$$ $$=$$ $$-1$$, there is perfect negative correlation.
The slope of the best-fit line tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (x) variable, on average.
$$r^2$$, when expressed as a percent, represents the percent of variation in the dependent (predicted) variable $$y$$ that can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable $$x$$ using the regression $$(best-fit)$$ line.
If $$r$$ $$=$$ $$1$$, there is perfect positive correlation. However, there is not enough of data points to support to show that there is a strong positive correlation between the data sets.
The sum of the squared error is the sum of absolute value of a residual errors.
The criteria for the best fit line is that the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized, that is, made as small as possible.
The correlation coefficient is calculated as below, where $$n$$ $$=$$ the number of data points.\n##figure1.gif##
If you suspect a linear relationship between $$x$$ and $$y$$, then $$r$$ can measure how strong the linear relationship is.
If $$r$$ $$=$$ $$1$$, there is perfect positive correlation.
If $$r$$ $$=$$ $$-1$$, there is perfect negative correlation
The sign of $$r$$ is the same as the sign of the slope, $$b$$, of the best-fit line.
The sign of $$r$$ is the same as the sign of the slope, $$b$$, of the best-fit line.
Strong correlation does not suggest that $$x$$ causes $$y$$ or $$y$$ causes $$x$$. We say "correlation does not imply causation."
$$r^2$$ ythat can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable $$x$$ using the regression $$(best-fit)$$ line.
If $$r$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ there is likely no linear correlation. It is important to view the scatterplot, however, because data that exhibit a curved or horizontal pattern may have a correlation of $$0$$.

Use the following equation L(x)=f(a)+f'(a)*(x - a) to make a linear approximation, where f(a) is the function and f'(a) is the derivative of the function.
Since we are looking for the linear approximation at $$x$$ $$=$$ $$9$$, we know that the formula is given by L(x) $$=$$ f(9) + f'(9)(x - 9).
Now, we must determine the values of f(a) and f'(a) to find L(x).
Given that $$x=9$$, what is f(a)?
The next step is finding f'(x) by taking the derivative of f(x) $$=$$ $$\sqrt{x}$$:\n$$f(x)=\sqrt{x}=x^{\frac{1}{2}}$$\nf'(x)=(1/2)*x**(1/2 - 2/2)\n$$f'(x)=\frac{1}{2} x^{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)}$$\n$$f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$$

$$L(9.1)$$ $$=$$ $$3$$ + (1/6)(9.1 - 9) $$=$$ $$3$$ + $$0.1\frac{1}{6}$$ $$=$$ $$3$$ + $$0.0166666$$ $$=$$ $$3.0167$$\n##figure1.gif##
The volume of a cube is given by V $$=$$ $$x^3$$.
If the side length is actually $$5.1$$ cm, then the volume of the cube is $$V(5.1)$$ $$=$$ $${5.1}^3$$. What is $$V(5.1)$$ in $${cm}^3$$?
From what we calculated, the actual volume of the cube will be between V(the lower side length) and $$132.651$$. Since the side length is measured to be $$5$$ cm, the computed volume is V(5).
What is V(5)?
To find the error in the computed volume, we must find the difference between the actual volume, $$V(5.1)$$, and the calculated volume, V(5).
What is the error in the computed volume?
From our answer, we know that the error in the computed volume is the following: the difference of the lower side length $$ \leq $$ ΔV $$ \leq $$ $$7.651$$. The estimated error dV is relatively close to the actual potential error in the computed volume.
If the measurement of the radius is accurate to within ±80, we have $$-80$$ $$ \leq $$ dr $$ \leq $$ $$80$$. Solve for dV.
The volume of a sphere is given by V $$=$$ $$\frac{4}{3} {pir}^3$$. Take the derivative of V to get the dV equation.
dV=(3*(4/3)*pi*r**(3 - 1))*dr=(4*pi*r**2)*dr
Using the measured radius of $$4000$$ mi, we can estimate by plugging $$r$$ $$=$$ $$4000$$ and dr $$=$$ $$80$$ into $$dV=4\pi r^2 dr$$.
What is dV (±)?
$$-4\pi {4000}^2\times80$$ $$ \leq $$ dV $$ \leq $$ $$4\pi {4000}^2\times80$$
To estimate the relative error, consider $$\frac{dV}{V}$$. Since we do not know the exact value of the volume V, use the measured radius $$r$$ $$=$$ $$4000$$ mi to estimate V. We obtain V ≈ $$\frac{4}{3} {\operatorname{\pi}\left(4000\right)}^3$$. Therefore, the relative error satisfies $$\frac{\left(-4\pi {4000}^2\times80\right)}{\frac{4\pi {4000}^3}{3}}$$ $$ \leq $$ $$\frac{dV}{V}$$ $$ \leq $$ $$\frac{4\pi {4000}^2\times80}{\frac{4\pi {4000}^3}{3}}$$. What does $$\frac{4\pi {4000}^2\times80}{\frac{4\pi {4000}^3}{3}}$$ simplify to?
$$-0.06$$ $$ \leq $$ $$\frac{dV}{V}$$ $$ \leq $$ $$0.06$$. Thus, the relative error is $$0.06$$.
If the measurement of the radius is accurate to within ±80, we have $$-80$$ $$ \leq $$ dr $$ \leq $$ $$80$$. Solve for dV.
The volume of a sphere is given by $$V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$$. Take the derivative of V to get the dV equation.

We obtain V ≈ $$\frac{4}{3} {\operatorname{\pi}\left(4000\right)}^3$$. Therefore, the relative error satisfies $$\frac{\left(-4\pi {4000}^2\times80\right)}{\frac{4\pi {4000}^3}{3}}$$ $$ \leq $$ $$\frac{dV}{V}$$ $$ \leq $$ $$\frac{4\pi {4000}^2\times80}{\frac{4\pi {4000}^3}{3}}$$. What does $$\frac{4\pi {4000}^2\times80}{\frac{4\pi {4000}^3}{3}}$$ simplify to?
$$-0.06$$ $$ \leq $$ $$\frac{dV}{V}$$ $$ \leq $$ $$0.06$$. Thus, the relative error is $$0.06$$. Convert $$0.06$$ to a percentage to get the percentage error.
Solve for $$0.06\times100$$ to convert the relative error, $$0.06$$, to a percentage error. What answer do you get?
$$0.06\times100$$ $$=$$ $$6$$. Thus, the percentage error is 6%.
The linear function is defined by $$L(x)=f{\left(a\right)}+\operatorname{f'}\left(a\right) \left(x-a\right)$$. This function L is also known as the linearization of f at $$x=a$$. When the linear approximation function is constant, $$\operatorname{f'}\left(a\right) \left(x-a\right)=0$$ such that $$f'(a)=0$$.
The linear approximation exact when $$y$$ $$=$$ f(x) is linear or constant.
Use the following equation $$L(x)=f{\left(a\right)}+\operatorname{f'}\left(a\right) \left(x-a\right)$$ to make a linear approximation, where f(a) is the function and f'(a) is the derivative of the function.
Since we are looking for the linear approximation at a $$=$$ $$2$$, we know that the formula is given by $$L(x)=f{\left(2\right)}+\operatorname{f'}\left(2\right) \left(x-2\right)$$.
Now, we must determine the values of f(a) and f'(a) to find L(x).
Given that a $$=$$ $$2$$, what is f(a)?
f(x) $$=$$ $$\frac{1}{x}$$ such that f(2) $$=$$ $$\frac{1}{2}$$.

What is f'(2)?
$$f'(2)=\frac{-1}{2^2}=\frac{-1}{4}$$
Now that we have found the values of f(2) and f'(2), plug them into $$L(x)=f{\left(a\right)}+\operatorname{f'}\left(a\right) \left(x-a\right)$$.
$$L(x)=\frac{1}{2}+\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) \left(x-2\right)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4} \left(x-2\right)$$.
Use the following equation $$L(x)=f{\left(a\right)}+\operatorname{f'}\left(a\right) \left(x-a\right)$$ to make a linear approximation, where f(a) is the function and f'(a) is the derivative of the function.
Since we are looking for the linear approximation at a $$=$$ $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$, we know that the formula is given by $$L(x)=f{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}+\operatorname{f'}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$$.

Now that we have found the values of $$f{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}$$ and $$\operatorname{f'}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$$, plug them into $$L(x)=f{\left(a\right)}+\operatorname{f'}\left(a\right) \left(x-a\right)$$.
$$L(x)=1+0\left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=1+0=1$$
Use the following equation $$L(x)=f{\left(a\right)}+\operatorname{f'}\left(a\right) \left(x-a\right)$$ to make a linear approximation, where f(a) is the function and f'(a) is the derivative of the function.
Since we are looking for the linear approximation at a $$=$$ $$0$$, we know that the formula is given by L(x) $$=$$ f(0) + f'(0)(x - 0).
Now, we must determine the values of f(a) and f'(a) to find L(x).
Given that a $$=$$ $$0$$, what is f(a)?
f(x) $$=$$ $${sin}^2 x$$ such that f(0) $$=$$ $${sin}^{2\left(0\right)}$$. What is $${sin}^{2\left(0\right)}$$? Use the graph to guide your answer, where $$x$$ $$=$$ cos(x) and $$y$$ $$=$$ sin(x). Remember that $${sin}^2 x$$ $$=$$ $$sin\left(x\right) sin\left(x\right)$$.\n##figure1.gif##
The next step is finding f'(x) by taking the derivative of f(x) $$=$$ $${sin}^2 x$$. By using the chain rule $$F'(x)=f'(g(x))(g'(x))$$, we first take the derivative of the outer function such that $$\frac{d}{dx} u^2$$ $$=$$ 2u. Next, we take the derivative of the inner function where $$\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{sinx}\left(x\right)$$ $$=$$ cos(x). Lastly, we combine the two steps through multiplication to get $$\frac{d}{dx} {sin}^2 x$$ $$=$$ f'(x) $$=$$ $$2u cos\left(x\right)$$ $$=$$ 2sin(x)cos(x).
Given that f'(a) $$=$$ 2sin(x)cos(x), what is f'(0)?
f'(0) $$=$$ $$2sin\left(0\right) cos\left(0\right)$$ $$=$$ $$2\times0\times1$$. What is the answer?

We can tell whether the parabola goes up or down based on the sign of a in the equation, $$y=a x^2+b x+c$$. If a is negative, then the parabola goes downwards, if it is positive, it goes upwards.
Since our a is negative, what does this tell us about our parabola?
Since our a is negative, we know that our parabola will open up downwards.
To find the vertex, we need to find the axis is symmetry, which is found using the formula, $$x=\frac{-b}{2} a$$.
To find the axis of symmetry, we have to find the $$b$$ and a from our equation.
Our $$b$$ and a are $$6$$ and $$-1$$ respectively. Our axis of symmetry is $$x=-1\frac{-6}{2}$$.
Now that we have our axis of symmetry, we want to plug it back into the original equation to find the $$y$$ value of our vertex.
Since our $$x$$ is $$3$$, we plug it into our equation as, $$y=-\left(3^2\right)+6\times3-8$$. This gives us $$y=1$$.
Since we know that our $$x$$ is $$3$$ and our $$y$$ is $$1$$, our vertex is at the coordinates, $$(3,1)$$.
To graph our parabola, we need to know our $$x$$ and $$y$$ intercepts.
Our y-intercept occurs when $$x=0$$. Knowing this, we substitute $$0$$ into our equation.
After plugging in $$x=0$$ to our equation, we see that a y-intercept occurs when $$y=-8$$, so our y-intercept is $$(0,-8)$$.
Our $$x$$ intercepts occur when $$y=0$$. We plug in $$y=0$$ to our equation and solve for the x's.
We must factor the GCF from our equation and factor the trinomial. After this, we solve for $$x$$, which are $$4$$ and $$2$$ in this case, so the x-intercepts are $$(4,0)$$ and $$(2,0)$$.
Now that we have all of our properties, we are ready to graph our parabolas.

One of the equations can represent the total cost of the event which we know to be $$\$2612.5$$. Since each child ticket costs $$\$7.5$$ we can multiply that with number of tickets to represent the total revenue of students. You can do the same with adult tickets and their sum would be equal to the total cost.
What is the equation equal to?
You can represent the relationship between child tickets and adult tickets using the information given.
What is the relationship
Seperate one variable in one of the equations and plug it in the second equation. In this case it would be easier to plug in $$x$$ $$=$$ $$2y-25$$ into the equation $$10y+7.5x=2612.5$$ which would equal $$10y+\operatorname{7.5}\left(2y-25\right)=2612.5$$
Use algebra to simplify the equation to solve for the missing variable (x)
Once you have a value for $$x$$ plug that value one of the two equations to get the value of $$y$$

Make sure all the word and ideas are understood. Determine the types of coins involved. Think about the strategy we used to find the value of the handful of coins. The first thing we need is to notice what type of coins are involved. Adalberto has dimes and nickels. Create a table to organize the information where the columns indicate the type of coin and the rows include the number of coins, their value, and their total value when multiplied. We can work this problem all in cents or in dollars. Here we'll do it in dollars and put in the dollar sign in the tail as a reminder. The value of a dime is $$\$0.10$$ and the value of a nickel is $$\$0.05$$. The total value of all the coins is $$\$2.25$$.
Choose a variable to represent the quantity for which we are looking for. So, let $$d=number$$ of dimes. $$d+9=number$$ of nickels
To get the total value of each type of coin, we can use the relationship: total value of a $$type=number$$ of coins of this $$type value$$ of this type.
We know that value of $$dimes+value$$ of $$nickels=total$$ value of coins. Plug in the numbers and variables, we get the equation $$0.1d+\operatorname{0.05}\left(d+9\right)=2.25$$.
To solve $$0.1d+\operatorname{0.05}\left(d+9\right)=2.25$$, we follow the following steps: 0.10d+0.05d+0.05*9=2.25-->0.15d=1.8-->d=12. Therefore, the number of dimes is $$12$$, and the number of nickels is $$12+9=21$$.
With $$12$$ dimes and $$21$$ nickels, does the total value equal $$\$2.25$$?

Choose a variable to represent the quantity for which we are looking for. So, let $$n=number$$ of nickels. $$n+7=number$$ of dimes.
To get the total value of each type of coin, we can use the relationship: total value of a $$type=number$$ of coins of this $$type value$$ of this type.
We know that value of $$dimes+value$$ of $$nickels=total$$ value of coins. Plug in the numbers and variables, we get the equation $$\operatorname{0.1}\left(n+7\right)+0.05n=2.05$$.
To solve $$\operatorname{0.1}\left(n+7\right)+0.05n=2.05$$, we follow the following steps: 0.10n+0.10*7+0.05n=2.05-->0.15n=1.35-->n=9. Therefore, the number of nickels is $$9$$, and the number of dimes is $$9+7=16$$.

Create a table to organize the information where the columns indicate the type of coin and the rows include the number of coins, their value, and their total value when multiplied. We can work this problem all in cents or in dollars. Here we'll do it in dollars and put in the dollar sign in the tail as a reminder. The value of a quarter is $$\$0.25$$ and the value of a nickel is $$\$0.05$$. The total value of all the coins is $$\$2.10$$.
Choose a variable to represent the quantity for which we are looking for. So, let $$q=number$$ of quarters. $$q+12=number$$ of nickels.
To get the total value of each type of coin, we can use the relationship: total value of a $$type=number$$ of coins of this $$type value$$ of this type.
We know that value of $$quarters+value$$ of $$nickels=total$$ value of coins. Plug in the numbers and variables, we get the equation $$0.25q+\operatorname{0.05}\left(q+12\right)=2.10$$.
To solve $$0.25q+\operatorname{0.05}\left(q+12\right)=2.10$$, we follow the following steps: 0.25q+0.05q+0.05*12=2.10-->0.3q=1.5-->q-5. Therefore, the number of quarters is $$5$$, and the number of nickels is $$5+12=17$$.

One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a function at a point by using a known value of a function at some given point, f(a), together with its rate of change at the given point, f'(a). If f(x) is a function defined on an interval [a, a + h], then the amount of change of f(x) over the interval is the change in the $$y$$ values of the function over that interval.
The function at some given point, a, is f(a), and its rate of change at the given point is f'(a). f(a + h) is the value that we wish to estimate. Solve for $$h$$.
What is a, the x-value at which the function is defined?
What is a + $$h$$, the x-value that we wish to estimate at?
Now that you have found the values of a and a + $$h$$, use the following equation (a + h) - a to solve for $$h$$.
What is $$h$$?
We can now solve for f(a + h) to get the amount of change formula: $$f{\left(a+h\right)}$$ ≈ f(a) + f'(a)h. Plug your values into this equation to solve for $$f(3.2)$$.
What is $$f(3.2)$$?
Plug a $$=$$ $$3$$ and $$h$$ $$=$$ $$0.2$$ into the amount of change formula to get $$f(3.2)$$ $$=$$ f(3 + $$0.2)$$ ≈ f(3) + $$f'(3)(0.2)$$.
In the problem, we are told that f(3) $$=$$ $$2$$ and f'(3) $$=$$ $$5$$. Substituting these values into $$f(3.2)$$ $$=$$ f(3 + $$0.2)$$ ≈ f(3) + $$f'(3)(0.2)$$, we get $$2$$ + $$5(0.2)$$.
$$2$$ + $$5(0.2)$$ $$=$$ $$2$$ + $$1$$ $$=$$ $$3$$
Let P(t) be the population (in thousands) $$t$$ years from now.
What is P(0)?
Since the current population is 10,000 and P(t) is the population (in thousands) $$t$$ years from now, we know that P(0) $$=$$ $$10$$. Based on this information, what can we anticipate that the population is if it triples every $$5$$ years?
The population of the city is tripling every $$5$$ years such that we can anticipate that the population is 30,000. In other words, P(5) $$=$$ $$30$$. Estimate P'(0), the current growth rate, using P'(0) ≈ (P(t_2) - P(t_1))/(t_2 - t_1).
What is P'(0)?
P'(0) ≈ (P(t_2) - P(t_1))/(t_2 - t_1), where $$t_1$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ and $$t_2$$ $$=$$ $$5$$.
P'(0) ≈ (P(5) - P(0))/(5 - 0)
P'(0) ≈ (30 - 10)/(5 - 0)
P'(0) ≈ $$\frac{20}{5}$$. What is P'(0)?
For small enough values of $$h$$, f'(a) ≈ f(a + h) - f(a)h. We can then solve for $$f{\left(a+h\right)}$$ to get the amount of change formula: f(a + h) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)h. Apply this equation to P(t) to estimate the population $$2$$ years from now.
P(2) ≈ P(0) + (2)P'(0)
P(2) ≈ $$10$$ + 2(4)
P(2) ≈ $$10$$ + $$8$$. What is P(2)?
P(2) $$=$$ $$18$$. Remember that P(t) is the population (in thousands) $$t$$ years from now. This means that P(2) is the population (in thousands) $$2$$ years from now. What is the approximate population $$2$$ years from now in thousands?
MR(x) $$=$$ R'(x), where R'(x) is the derivative of R(x).
What is R'(x)?
R(x) $$=$$ $$-0.03x^2$$ + $$9x$$\nR'(x) $$=$$ $$2\left(-0.03\right) x^{2-1}$$ + $$9$$\nR'(x) $$=$$ $$-0.06x$$ + $$9$$
Now that we know that MR(x) $$=$$ R'(x) $$=$$ $$-0.06x$$ + $$9$$, use R'(100) to approximate R(101) - R(100), the revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner.
What is R'(100)?
Plug $$x$$ $$=$$ $$100$$ into R'(x) $$=$$ $$-0.06x$$ + $$9$$ to solve for R'(100).
R'(100) $$=$$ $$-0.06(100)$$ + $$9$$ $$=$$ $$-6$$ + $$9$$. What is R'(100)?
Since R′(100) $$=$$ $$3$$, the revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is approximately $3.
The actual revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is R(101) - R(100).
What is R(101) - R(100)?
What is R(101)?
Plug $$x$$ $$=$$ $$101$$ into R(x) $$=$$ $$-0.03x^2$$ + $$9x$$ to solve for R(101).
R(x) $$=$$ $$-0.03x^2$$ + $$9x$$\nR(101) $$=$$ $$-\left({\operatorname{0.03}\left(101\right)}^2\right)$$ + 9(101)\nR(101) $$=$$ $$-306.03$$ + $$909$$\nR(101) $$=$$ $$602.97$$
What is R(100)?
Plug $$x$$ $$=$$ $$100$$ into R(x) $$=$$ $$-0.03x^2$$ + $$9x$$ to solve for R(100).
R(x) $$=$$ $$-0.03x^2$$ + $$9x$$\nR(100) $$=$$ $$-\left({\operatorname{0.03}\left(100\right)}^2\right)$$ + 9(100)\nR(100) $$=$$ $$-300$$ + $$900$$\nR(100) $$=$$ $$600$$
Now that you have determined that R(101) $$=$$ $$602.97$$ and R(100) $$=$$ $$600$$, what is R(101) - R(100)?
R(101) - R(100) $$=$$ $$602.97$$ - $$600$$. What is the actual revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner?
Since the estimated revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is approximately $3, and the actual revenue was $$\$2.97$$, the marginal revenue is a fairly good estimate in this case and has the advantage of being easy to compute.

What is s'(t)?
v(t) $$=$$ s'(t)\ns(t) $$=$$ $$2t^3$$ - $$15t^2$$ + $$36t$$ - $$10$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$3\times2 t^{3-1}$$ - $$2\times15 t^{2-1}$$ + $$36$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$6t^2$$ - $$30t$$ + $$36$$
One use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. Let s(t) be a function giving the position of an object at time $$t$$. The acceleration of the object at time $$t$$ is given by a(t) $$=$$ v'(t) $$=$$ s''(t), where a(t) is the acceleration, v'(t) is the derivative of the velocity, and s''(t) is the double derivative of s(t). First, solve for s'(t) or v(t).
First, what is s'(t)?
s(t) $$=$$ $$2t^3$$ - $$15t^2$$ + $$36t$$ - $$10$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$3\times2 t^{3-1}$$ - $$2\times15 t^{2-1}$$ + $$36$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$6t^2$$ - $$30t$$ + $$36$$
Now that you have calculated s'(t), what is s''(t)?
s'(t) $$=$$ $$6t^2$$ - $$30t$$ + $$36$$\ns''(t) $$=$$ $$2\times6 t^{2-1}$$ - $$30$$\ns''(t) $$=$$ $$12t$$ - $$30$$\nThus, a(t) $$=$$ $$12t$$ - $$30$$
One use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. Let s(t) be a function giving the position of an object at time $$t$$. The velocity of the object at time $$t$$ is given by v(t) $$=$$ s'(t), the derivative of s(t). First, solve for s'(t).
What is s'(t)?

What is s'(t)?
v(t) $$=$$ s'(t)\ns(t) $$=$$ $$-16t^2$$ + $$560t$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$2\left(-16\right) t^{2-1}$$ + $$560$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$-32t$$ + $$560$$
Now that you have calculated s'(t), what is s''(t)?
s'(t) $$=$$ $$-32t$$ + $$560$$\ns''(t) $$=$$ $$1\left(-32\right) t^{1-1}$$\ns''(t) $$=$$ $$-32$$
Normally, we would plug $$t$$ $$=$$ $$3$$ into a(t) $$=$$ $$-32$$, but because there is no $$t$$ value on the right side of the equation, this means that at any given time, the acceleration of the rocket is $$-32$$ $$\frac{ft}{s^2}$$. Thus, the acceleration of the rocket $$3$$ seconds after being fired is $$-32$$ ft/ $$s^2$$.
One use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. Let s(t) be a function giving the position of an object at time $$t$$. The velocity of the object at time $$t$$ is given by v(t) $$=$$ s'(t), the derivative of s(t). First, set s(t) to $$0$$ and solve for $$t$$.
The problem asks us to determine the velocity $$\frac{ft}{s}$$ of the car when s(t) $$=$$ $$0$$. Solve for s(t) $$=$$ $$t^2$$ - $$3t$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$0$$.
What is $$t^2-3t-4=0$$?
$$t^2-3t-4=0$$\n$$t=\frac{3\pm \sqrt{3^2+4\times4}}{2}$$\n$$t=\frac{3\pm 5}{2}$$\n$$t=\frac{3+5}{2}=\frac{8}{2}=4$$ and $$t=\frac{3-5}{2}=\frac{-2}{2}=-1$$\nBecause time can only be positive, the time in which s(t) $$=$$ $$0$$ is $$4$$.
Now that we have determined that $$t$$ $$=$$ $$4$$ when s(t) $$=$$ $$0$$, we can plug the time into the velocity function given by v(t) $$=$$ s'(t), the derivative of s(t). Solve for the velocity function.
What is s'(t)?
v(t) $$=$$ s'(t)\ns(t) $$=$$ $$t^2$$ - $$3t$$ - $$4$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$2t^{2-1}$$ - $$3$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$2t$$ - $$3$$

One use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. Let s(t) be a function giving the position of an object at time $$t$$. The velocity of the object at time $$t$$ is given by v(t) $$=$$ s'(t), the derivative of s(t). First, set s(t) to $$14$$ and solve for $$t$$.
The problem asks us to determine the velocity $$\frac{ft}{s}$$ of the car when s(t) $$=$$ $$14$$. Solve for s(t) $$=$$ $$t^2$$ - $$3t$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$14$$.
What is $$t^2$$ - $$3t$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ 14?

Now that we have determined that $$t$$ $$=$$ $$6$$ when s(t) $$=$$ $$14$$, we can plug the time into the velocity function given by v(t) $$=$$ s'(t), the derivative of s(t). Solve for the velocity function.
What is s'(t)?
v(t) $$=$$ s'(t)\ns(t) $$=$$ $$t^2$$ - $$3t$$ - $$4$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$2t^{2-1}$$ - $$3$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$2t$$ - $$3$$

One use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. Let s(t) be a function giving the position of an object at time $$t$$. The average velocity of the object is given by $$v_{ave}$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$, where Δx is the displacement (total distance travelled) and Δt is the change in time.
The first step is determining how long it takes the ball to reach the ground. To do this, set s(t) $$=$$ $$0$$ and solve for $$t$$.
What is $$t$$, the time (in seconds) that it takes for the ball to reach the ground?
Since we have determined that $$t$$ $$=$$ $$2$$ when the ball hits the ground, we know that Δt $$=$$ the end time - the start time $$=$$ $$2$$ - $$0$$ $$=$$ $$2$$. Now, we can determine Δx, the displacement, by solving for s(t $$=$$ $$2)-s(t$$ $$=$$ 0).
What is Δx, the displacement?
The time it takes for the ball to reach the ground is $$t$$ $$=$$ $$2$$ seconds. What is s(2)?
The initial time is $$t$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ seconds. What is s(0)?
Given that s(2) $$=$$ $$0$$ and s(0) $$=$$ $$64$$, what is Δx, the displacement?
Δx $$=$$ s(2) - s(0). What is $$0$$ - 64?
$$v_{ave}$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$. What is the average velocity $$\frac{ft}{s}$$?
$$v_{ave}$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$ $$=$$ $$\frac{-64}{2}$$ $$=$$ ?
The direction of motion is determined by the velocity. Begin by finding v(t) where v(t) $$=$$ s'(t), the derivative of s(t). A positive or negative sign of acceleration indicates if the velocity is increasing or decreasing. If v(t) > $$0$$, the particle is moving from left to right. If v(t) < $$0$$, the particle is moving from right to left. If v(t) $$=$$ $$0$$, there is no direction of motion.
What is v(t), the velocity of the particle? Write out the full function.
To determine v(t), we must take the derivative of s(t) $$=$$ $$t^3$$ - $$4t$$ + $$2$$.\ns(t) $$=$$ $$t^3$$ - $$4t$$ + $$2$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$3\left(t^{3-1}\right)$$ - $$4$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$3t^2$$ - $$4$$
v(t) $$=$$ $$3t^2$$ - $$4$$. What is v(1)?
v(1) $$=$$ $$3\left(1^2\right)$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ 3(1) - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$3$$ - $$4$$. What is v(1)?
A positive or negative sign of acceleration indicates if the velocity is increasing or decreasing. If v(t) > $$0$$, the particle is moving from left to right. If v(t) < $$0$$, the particle is moving from right to left. If v(t) $$=$$ $$0$$, there is no direction of motion. Is v(t) equal to, greater than, or less than 0?
v(1) $$=$$ $$-1$$ such that v(t) < $$0$$. What is the direction of motion of the particle?
The speeding up or slowing down of an object is determined by the velocity and acceleration. Whenever the particle's velocity and acceleration have the same sign (positive or negative), the particle's speed is increasing. Likewise, when the particle's velocity and acceleration have opposing signs (one positive, one negative), the particle's speed is decreasing. Begin by finding the velocity (v(t) $$=$$ s'(t), the derivative of s(t)) and the acceleration (a(t) $$=$$ v'(t) $$=$$ s''(t)).
What is v(t), the velocity of the particle? Write out the full function.
To determine v(t), we must take the derivative of s(t) $$=$$ $$t^3$$ - $$4t$$ + $$2$$.\ns(t) $$=$$ $$t^3$$ - $$4t$$ + $$2$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$3\left(t^{3-1}\right)$$ - $$4$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$3t^2$$ - $$4$$
v(t) $$=$$ $$3t^2$$ - $$4$$. What is v(1)?
v(1) $$=$$ $$3\left(1^2\right)$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ 3(1) - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$3$$ - $$4$$. What is v(1)?
A positive or negative sign of acceleration indicates if the velocity is increasing or decreasing. If v(t) > $$0$$, the particle is moving from left to right. If v(t) < $$0$$, the particle is moving from right to left. If v(t) $$=$$ $$0$$, there is no direction of motion. Is v(t) equal to, greater than, or less than 0?
What is a(t), the acceleration of the particle? Write out the full function.
To determine a(t), we must take the derivative of v(t) $$=$$ $$3t^2$$ - $$4$$.\nv(t) $$=$$ $$3t^2$$ - $$4$$\nv'(t) $$=$$ $$2\left(3\right) t^{2-1}$$\nv'(t) $$=$$ $$6t$$
a(t) $$=$$ $$6t$$. What is a(1)?
a(1) $$=$$ $$6t$$ $$=$$ 6(1). What is a(1)?
A positive or negative sign of acceleration indicates the rate at which the velocity is changing. If a(t) > $$0$$, the rate of the velocity is increasing. If a(t) < $$0$$, the rate of the velocity is decreasing. If a(t) $$=$$ $$0$$, there is no rate of change in the velocity. Is a(t) equal to, greater than, or less than 0?
Are the directions of motion between the velocity and acceleration the same or different?
Because v(1) < $$0$$ and a(1) > $$0$$, the velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite directions. The same direction of motion would indicate the speeding up of the particle whereas the opposite directions of motion would indicate the slowing down of the particle. Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at $$t$$ $$=$$ 1?
Because v(1) < $$0$$ and a(1) > $$0$$, the velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite directions. In other words, the particle is being accelerated in the direction opposite the direction in which it is traveling, causing |v(t)| to decrease. The particle is slowing down.
v(t) $$=$$ s'(t), where s'(t) is the derivative of s(t). Solve for s'(t).
What is s'(t), the velocity of the particle?
To determine v(t), we must take the derivative of s(t) $$=$$ $$t^3$$ - $$9t^2$$ + $$24t$$ + $$4$$, $$t$$ $$ \geq $$ $$0$$.\ns(t) $$=$$ $$t^3$$ - $$9t^2$$ + $$24t$$ + $$4$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$3t^{3-1}$$ - $$2\left(9\right) t^{2-1}$$ + $$24$$\ns'(t) $$=$$ $$3t^2$$ - $$18t$$ + $$24$$
The particle is at rest when v(t) $$=$$ $$0$$. Set $$3t^2$$ - $$18t$$ + $$24$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ and solve for $$t$$.
What is $$t$$? If your answer has multiple times, separate them by commas. For example, "1,2".
Factor the left-hand side of the equation to produce 3(t - 2)(t - 4) $$=$$ $$0$$.
When solving for $$t$$, we can simplify the equation 3(t - 2)(t - 4) $$=$$ $$0$$ to get $$t$$ - $$2$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ and $$t$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$0$$ by dividing by $$3$$ on both sides.
We find that the particle is at rest at $$t$$ $$=$$ $$2$$ and $$t$$ $$=$$ $$4$$. Thus, your answer should be "2,4".
The particle is moving from left to right when v(t) > $$0$$. The sign of v(t) determines the direction of the particle.
The number line shown presents the signs of v(t), where the numbers at the bottom represent the times.\n##figure1.gif##
To determine the time intervals that the particle is moving from left to right, we must locate where v(t) > $$0$$. In other words, we must find the times frames in which v(t) is positive.
In the number line, v(t) is shown to be positive from $$0$$ to $$2$$ and $$4$$ to $$\infty$$.\n##figure2.gif##
Now that we know that the time intervals in which the particle is moving left to right is $$0$$ to $$2$$ and $$4$$ to $$+\infty$$, we must now construct this into a cohesive range statement. Square brackets mean that the end point is included, and round parentheses mean that it is excluded. Infinity symbols are always accompanied by round (exclusive) brackets, and U is used to combine intervals. Thus, the time interval is [0,2) U (4,+∞).

First, set up the hypothesis test. Since the problem is about a mean, this is a test of a single population mean.
The 1% level of significance means that $$\alpha=0.01$$. Based on the problem, $$H_0$$: $$p=0.50$$ and $$H_a$$: $$p \neq 0.50$$. The words "is the same or different from" tell you this is a two-tailed test.

$$q=1-p$$. What is q?
What is $$n$$?
p-value=P(p′<0.47 or p′>0.53)=0.5485
$$p′=0.53$$. Since the curve is symmetrical and the test is two-tailed, the p′ for the left tail is equal to $$0.50-0.03=0.47$$ where $$μ=p=0.50$$. $$(0.03$$ is the difference between $$0.53$$ and $$0.50.)$$
Compare 𝛼 and the $$p-value$$.

Compare \alpha and the $$p-value$$.
Is \alpha less than or greater than the $$p-value$$?
Since \alpha>p-value, we would reject $$H_0$$. This means that you reject $$μ=16.43$$. In other words, you do not think Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle in $$16.43$$ seconds but faster with the new goggles. Find the conclusion that matches with this idea.

Determine the distribution needed. No population standard deviation given, and you are only given $$n=10$$ sample data values.
Use $$t_{df}$$. Therefore, the distribution for the test is $$t_9$$ where $$n=10$$ and $$df=10-1=9$$. Now, calculate the $$p-value$$ using the Student's $$t-distribution$$.
$$p-value=P\left(x>67\right)=0.0396$$ where the sample mean and sample standard deviation are calculated as $$67$$ and $$3.1972$$ from the data.
Compare \alpha and the $$p-value$$.
Is \alpha less than or greater than the $$p-value$$?
Since \alpha>p-value, we would reject $$H_0$$. This means you reject $$μ=65$$. In other words, you believe the average test score is greater than $$65$$.
$$H_a$$ tells you the whether the tail is left-, right, or two-tailed.

If one of the data points has the form (0,a), then a is the initial value. Using a, substitute the second point into the equation $$f(x)={a\left(b\right)}^x$$, and solve for $$b$$.
In this problem, the coordinate $$(0,6)$$ is given. Thus, following the previous hint, $$a=6$$. We can then plug in the other given point, $$(3,750)$$, to $$f(x)={a\left(b\right)}^x$$. This gives us $$750={6\left(b\right)}^3$$. What is $$b$$?
Write the formula in the form $$f(x)={a\left(b\right)}^x$$.
If one of the data points has the form (0,a), then a is the initial value. Using a, substitute the second point into the equation $$f(x)={a\left(b\right)}^x$$, and solve for $$b$$.
In this problem, the coordinate $$(0,2000)$$ is given. Thus, following the previous hint, $$a=2000$$. We can then plug in the other given point, $$(2,20)$$, to $$f(x)={a\left(b\right)}^x$$. This gives us $$200={\operatorname{2000}\left(b\right)}^2$$. What is $$b$$?
Write the formula in the form $$f(x)={a\left(b\right)}^x$$.
We can still find an exponential formula with two points that are not in the form (0,a). First, subsitute both points into two equations with the form $$f(x)={a\left(b\right)}^x$$. Solve the resulting system of two equations in two unknowns to find a and $$b$$.
Plugging in the first data point, we get $$\frac{3}{2}={a\left(b\right)}^{\left(-1\right)}$$.

First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents Anna's rent (r).
We know that Emma's monthly income must be at least three times the rent. So, we have the inequality $$3r \leq 5625$$
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$r$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To do this, we can divide both sides by $$3$$ to isolate $$r$$. We now have $$r \leq 1875$$ as our inequality.
Since $$r$$ must be less than or equal to 1,875 dollars, what is the maximum rent?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents Mona's budget.
We know that Mona has a budget of $285 and the Fun Zone charges $19 per child. Let's call the number of child $$x$$, so we have the inequality $$19x \leq 285$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To do this, we can divide both sides by $$19$$ to isolate $$x$$. We now have $$x \leq 15$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be less than or equal to $$15$$, what is the maximum number of children Mona can have at the party?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the load of the water taxi.
We know that the maximum load of the water taxi is 1,800 pounds and the average weight of one person is $$150$$ pounds. If there are $$x$$ people, then the total weight would be $$150x$$. Therefore, we can create the inequality $$150x \leq 1800$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To do this, we can divide both sides by $$150$$ to isolate $$x$$. We now have $$x \leq 12$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be less than or equal to $$12$$, what is the maximum number of people that can safely ride in the water taxi?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the total cost of iced drink.
We know that Arleen can pay a maximum of $20 with her gift card and each iced drink costs $$\$3.79$$. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of iced drinks she buy, then the total cost would be $$3.79x$$. Therefore, we have the inequality $$3.79x \leq 20$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To do this, we can divide both sides by $$3.79$$ to isolate $$x$$. We now have $$x \leq 5.277$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be less than or equal to $$5.277$$ and $$x$$ has to be a whole number, what is the maximum number of drinks Arleen can buy with the gift card?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the total earning Joni makes.
We know that Joni wants her earning to be at least $1000, and each kitchen apron can be sold for $$\$32.50$$. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of kitchen aprons Joni sells, then her total earning would be $$32.5x$$. Therefore, we have the inequality $$32.5x \geq 1000$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To do this, we can divide both sides by $$32.5$$ to isolate $$x$$. We now have $$x \geq 30.77$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$30.77$$ and $$x$$ has to be a whole number, what is the minimum number of kitchen aprons Joni has to sell?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the total earning Keshad makes.
We know that Keshad wants his earning to be at least $3300, and he gets paid $2400 per month plus 6% (which is $$0.06$$ in decimals) of his sales. If we let $$x$$ represent his total sales, then his total earning is $$2400+0.06x$$. Therefore, we get the inequality $$2400+0.06x \geq 3300$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate $$x$$, we can first subtract $$2400$$ from both sides and then divide both sides by $$0.06$$. We now have $$x \geq 15000$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$15000$$, what is the minimum sales Keshad has to make?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the total earning Andre makes.
We know that Andre wants his earning to be at least $62,000, and he gets paid $48,000 per year plus $$3.5\%$$ (which is $$0.035$$ in decimals) of his sales. If we let $$x$$ represent his total sales, then his total earning is $$48000+0.035x$$. Therefore, we get the inequality $$48000+0.035x \geq 62000$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate $$x$$, we can first subtract $$48000$$ from both sides and then divide both sides by $$0.035$$. We now have $$x \geq 400000$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$400000$$, what is the minimum sales Andre has to make?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the amount Jake pays for his water bill.
We know that Jake wants his water bill to be less than or equal to $60, and his bill consists of a fixed charge of $$\$24.80$$ per month and an additional $$\$2.20$$ per ccf of water used. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of ccf Jake uses, then the total amount of the water bill would be $$24.8+2.2x$$. Therefore, we get the inequality $$24.8+2.2x \leq 60$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate $$x$$, we can subtract $$24.8$$ from both sides and then divide both sides by $$0.035$$. We now have $$x \leq 16$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be less than or equal to $$16$$, what is the maximum number of ccf Jake can use?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the amount of Marlon's monthly TV bill.
We know that Marlon wants his monthly TV bill to be less than or equal to $100, and his bill consists of a fixed charge of $$\$49.99$$ per month and an additional $$\$5.49$$ for each first-run movie. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of first-run movies Marlon purchases, then the total amount of his TV bill would be $$49.99+5.49x$$. Therefore, we get the inequality $$49.99+5.49x \leq 100$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate $$x$$, we can subtract $$49.99$$ from both sides and then divide both sides by $$5.49$$. We now have $$x \leq 9.109$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be less than or equal to $$9.109$$ and $$x$$ has to be a whole number, what is the maximum number of first-run movies Jake can watch?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the amount of Moshde's monthly income.
We know that Moshde wants to save $1,200 each month. We also know that she spends $960 each month, and she earns $45 for each haircut and style. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of haircut and style Moshde does each month, then her total monthly income would be $$45x$$. Since all income are either spent or saved, we get the inequality $$45x \geq 1200+960$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate $$x$$, we can simplify the right hand side and then divide both sides by $$45$$. We now have $$x \geq 48$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$48$$, what is the minimum number of haircut and style Moshde must do per month?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the amount of Katherin monthly income.
We know that Katherine wants to make a profit of at least $1,900 each month and has a monthly expense of $3,150. We also know that she charges $115 per four-person meal. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of four-person meals Katherine sells each month, then her total monthly income would be $$115x$$. Since profit is the difference between total income and the amount of expense, we get the inequality $$115x-3150 \geq 1900$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate $$x$$, we can add $$3150$$ to both sides and then divide both sides by $$115$$. We now have $$x \geq 43.913$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$43.913$$ and $$x$$ has to be a whole number, what is the minimum number of four-person meals Katherine has to sell per month?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the number of tablets (n) Dawn can buy.
We know that $254.12*(the number of tablets) is no more than $4,000. So, we can create the inequality $$254.12n \leq 4000$$
Now we must solve the inequality by isolating $$n$$.
To do this, we need to divide both sides by $$254.12$$. Now, we have $$n \leq 15.74$$ as our inequality.
Since the number of tablets can only be a whole number, we must round the inequality. Now, we have $$n \leq 15$$.
Since $$n$$ must be less than or equal to $$15$$, what is the maximum number of tablets that Dawn can buy?
The first thing we need to do is to solve for the total expenses that the five student government officers need to pay. Once we know the total expense, we can find out the additional amount of money that the officers need to make up for by washing cars.
To find the total expense, we sum up the expense from registration ($110), transportation and food ($375), and hotel (5*$42).
What is $$110+375+5\times42$$?
We know that the five student government officers need $695 in total, but they only have $450 currently. What is the amount that they will need to earn by themselves?
We know that the five student government officers need to earn at least $245 by washing cars and they charge $5 per car. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of cars they wash, then the total earning from the car wash would be $$5x$$. Therefore, we get the inequality $$5x \geq 245$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To solve for $$x$$, we can divide both sides by $$5$$ to isolate $$x$$. We now have $$x \geq 49$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$49$$, what is the minimum number of cars the student government officers have to wash?
The first thing we need to do is to solve for the total expenses Alonzo has to pay. Once we know the total expense, we can find out the additional amount of money Alonzo needs to make by detailing cars.
To find the total expense, we sum up the expense from paying the application fees ($120), security deposit ($950), and the rent for the first and last months (2*$1140).
What is $$120+950+2\times1140$$?
We know that Alonzo needs $3,350 in total, but he only has $1,810 currently. What is the additional amount that he will need to earn?
We know that Alonzo needs to earn at least $1,540 by detailing cars and he charges $175 per car. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of cars he details, then the total earning from the car detailing would be $$175x$$. Therefore, we get the inequality $$175x \geq 1540$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To solve for $$x$$, we can divide both sides by $$175$$ to isolate $$x$$. We now have $$x \geq 8.8$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$8.8$$ and $$x$$ has to be a whole number, what is the minimum number of cars Alonzo has to detail?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the total cost of classes.
We know that the maximum cost Marcela can afford is $1,365, and each unit costs $105. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of units Marcela takes, then the total cost would be $$105x$$. Therefore, we have the inequality $$105x \leq 1365$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To do this, we can divide both sides by $$105$$ to isolate $$x$$. We now have $$x \leq 13$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be less than or equal to $$13$$, what is the maximum number of units Marcela can take?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the total earning Ryan makes.
We know that Ryan wants his earning to be at least $1,500, and he charges his neighbors $$\$17.50$$ to wash their car. If we let $$x$$ represent the number of cars Ryan washes, then his total earning would be $$17.5x$$. Therefore, we have the inequality $$17.5x \geq 1500$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To do this, we can divide both sides by $$17.5$$ to isolate $$x$$. We now have $$x \geq 85.714$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$85.714$$ and $$x$$ has to be a whole number, what is the minimum number of cars Ryan needs to wash?
First, we must transfer the word problem into an inequality that represents the total earning Kimuyen makes.
We know that Kimuyen wants her earning to be at least $4,150, and he gets paid $3,475 per month plus 4% (which is $$0.04$$ in decimals) of her total sales. If we let $$x$$ represent her total sales, then her total earning is $$3475+0.04x$$. Therefore, we get the inequality $$3475+0.04x \geq 4150$$.
Now, we must solve the inequality for $$x$$ by algebrically manipulating it.
To isolate $$x$$, we can first subtract $$3475$$ from both sides and then divide both sides by $$0.04$$. We now have $$x \geq 16875$$ as our inequality.
Since $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$16875$$, what is the minimum sales Kimuyen has to make?
We know that $500+12% of Peter's sales must be greater than $925. If we let s equal the number of sales, then we can create an inequality representing a relationship between Peter's sales and his weekly pay.
We can represent the situation with the inequality $$500+0.12s>925$$
We must now solve the inequality by isolating the variable s. This can be done by algebraically mainpulating the inequality.
The first step is to subtract $$500$$ from both sides of the inequality. We now have $$0.12s>425$$.
Now, we must divide both sides of the inequality by $$0.12$$. Now, we have: $$s>3541.67$$.
Now all we have to do is describe the inequality with words. If Peter wants a weekly play greater than $925, what is the minimum sales he needs to make ($)?
First, we must translate the word problem into an inequality that represents the number of boxes one pallet can support.
Since we know that the boxes weight $$45$$ pounds each, and they cannot weigh more than $$900$$ pounds in total, let's let $$n$$ equal the number of boxes. Now, we have the inequality $$45n \leq 900$$.
Now, we must isolate the variable $$n$$ in order to calculate the maximum number of boxes a pallet can support.
To isolate $$n$$, we must divide both sides by 45; we now have $$n \leq 20$$.
Since we know that $$n$$ must be less than or equal to $$20$$, what is the maximum number of boxes one pallet can support?
First, we must transfer the word problen into an inequality that represents the maximum number of people that can ride in the elvator safely.
Since we know that the maximum weight one elevator can support is 2,100 pounds and that the average weight of one person is $$150$$ pounds, we can let $$n$$ equal the number of people in the elevator and create the following inequality: $$150n \leq 2100$$.
Now, we must isolate $$n$$ so that we are able to calculate its value.
To isolate $$n$$, we must divide both sides by $$150$$. We now have $$n \leq 14$$.
Since $$n$$ must be less than or equal to $$14$$, what is the maximum number of people the elevator can safely support?
First, we must create an inequality that represents the maximum number of juice packs Angie can buy based on the amount of money she has.
We know that the total price of the juice boxes must be less than or equal to $$20$$. If we let $$n$$ equal the number of juice boxes, we have then inequality: $$2.63n \leq 20$$
Now, we must isolate the variable $$n$$ by algebraically manipulating the inequality.
To isolate $$n$$, we must divide both sides by $$2.63$$. We now have the inequality $$n \leq 7.60$$.
Since we know that $$n$$, the number of juice boxes, must be less than or equal to $$7.6$$, what is the maximum (whole) number of juice boxes Angie can buy?
We must first write an inequality to represent the number of people Daniel can have at his party (n) in terms of the amount of money he has ($500).
Since we know that the cost for dinner is $$\$42.75$$ per person, 42.75*(the number of people) must be less than or equal to $500, which is the budget. This can be represented by the inequality $$42.75n \leq 500$$
We must now isolate the variable $$n$$ so that we can calculate the maximum number of people Daniel can have at the party.
To isolate the variable, we must divide both sides of the inequality by $$42.75$$. We now have $$n \leq 11.695$$.
Since we know that $$n$$, the number of people Daniel can have at his party, must be less than or equal to $$11.695$$, what is the maximum (whole) number of people Daniel can have at the party?
We must first create an inequality to represent Tiffany's salary with respect to her total number of sales, $$n$$.
We know that $20,000 plus $$2$$ percent (or $$0.02)$$ of Tiffany's sales must be at least $100,000. This means that $$20000+0.02n \geq 100000$$, where $$n$$ is the total number of Tiffany's sales.
To solve this inequality, we need to isolate the variable $$n$$.
To start, we can subtract 20,000 from both sides of the inequality. We now have $$0.02n \geq 80000$$.
We now need to divide both sides of the inequality by $$0.02$$. This means that $$n \geq 4000000$$.
Since we know that $$n$$, Tiffany's total sales, must be greater than or equal to $$4000000$$, what is the minimum sale she has to make?
We must first create an inequality to represent Christian's salary with respect to his total number of sales, $$n$$.
We know that $24,000 plus $$3$$ percent (or $$0.03)$$ of Christian's sales must be greater than $60,000. This means that $$24000+0.03n>60000$$, where $$n$$ represents the total number of Christian's sales.
To solve this inequality, we need to isolate the variable $$n$$.
To start, we can subtract 24,000 from both sides of the inequality. We now have $$0.03n>36000$$.
We now need to divide both sides of the inequality by $$0.03$$. This means that $$n>1200000$$.
Since we know that $$n$$, Christian's total number of sales, must be greater than $$1200000$$, what is the minimum sale she has to make?

$$\ln(ab)$$ is equivalent to $$\ln(a)+\ln(b)$$ by product rule.
We can use the power rule as follows. We know that the exponent that $$\log_{b}\left(M^n\right)=n\log_{b}\left(M\right)$$. In this case, $$M=4$$ and $$n=2$$. So, $$2\log_{3}\left(4\right)=\log_{3}\left(4^2\right)=\log_{3}\left(16\right)$$
Using the quotient rule, $$\ln(\frac{x^4 y}{7})=\ln(x^4 y)-\ln(7)$$
Using the product rule, $$\ln(x^4 y)-\ln(7)=\ln(x^4)+\ln(y)-\ln(7)$$
Using the power rule, $$\ln(x^4)+\ln(y)-\ln(7)=4\ln(x)+\ln(y)-\ln(7)$$
Using the quotient rule, log((x**2*y**3)/z**4))=log(x**2*y**3)-log(z**4)
Using the product rule, $$\ln(x^2 y^3)-\ln(z^4)=\ln(x^2)+\ln(y^3)-\ln(z^4)$$
Using the power rule, $$\ln(x^2)+\ln(y^3)-\ln(z^4)=2\ln(x)+3\ln(y)-4\ln(z)$$
To enable the use of the power rule, we may rewrite $$\sqrt{x}$$ as $$x^{\frac{1}{2}}$$. This means that $$\ln(\sqrt{x})=\ln(x^{\frac{1}{2}})$$
Using the power rule, $$\ln(x^{\frac{1}{2}})=\frac{1}{2} \ln(x)$$
By Power rule, $$\ln(a^b)=\operatorname{blog}\left(a\right)$$.
Using the power rule, $$\log_{3}\left(5\right)+\log_{3}\left(8\right)-\log_{3}\left(2\right)=\log_{3}\left(40\right)-\log_{3}\left(2\right)$$

Using the power rule, $$\ln(3)-\ln(4)+\ln(5)-\ln(6)=\ln(3)+\ln(5)-\ln(4)-\ln(6)=\ln(15)-\ln(24)$$
Using the quotient rule, $$\ln(15)-\ln(24)=\ln(\frac{15}{24})$$
$$\ln(ab)$$ is equivalent to $$\ln(a)+\ln(b)$$ by product rule.
$$((15x)(x-1))=3\times5 x \left(x-1\right)$$. $$\left(3x+4\right) \left(2-x\right)=\left(3x+4\right) \left(2-x\right)$$.
$$\ln(\frac{a}{b})$$ is equivalent to $$\ln(a)-\ln(b)$$
$$7x^2+21x=7x\left(x+3\right)$$. $$(7x(x-1)(x-2))=7x \left(x-1\right) \left(x-2\right)$$. We can now use the product and quotient rules and expand.
Using the quotient and product rules, we can write the expression with many logarithms.
We can use the power rule as follows. We know that the exponent that $$\log_{b}\left(M^n\right)=n\log_{b}\left(M\right)$$. In this case, $$M=x$$ and $$n=5$$. This means that $$\log_{2}\left(x^5\right)=5\log_{2}\left(x\right)$$
We can use the power rule as follows. We know that the exponent that $$\log_{b}\left(M^n\right)=n\log_{b}\left(M\right)$$. In this case, $$M=x$$ and $$n=2$$. This means that $$\ln(x^2)=2ln(x)$$
Since we know that $$25=5^2$$, we can replace $$25$$ with $$5^2$$ in the log such that we now have $$\log_{3}\left(5^2\right)$$. You may notice tthat this allows us to simplify with the power rule.
We can use the power rule as follows. We know that the exponent that $$\log_{b}\left(M^n\right)=n\log_{b}\left(M\right)$$. In this case, $$M=5$$ and $$n=2$$. This means that $$\log_{3}\left(5^2\right)=2\log_{3}\left(5\right)$$
We must notice that $$\frac{1}{x^2}$$ can be written as $$x^{\left(-2\right)}$$, allowing us to use the power rule to simplify the log. We now have $$\ln(x^{\left(-2\right)})$$
We can use the power rule as follows. We know that the exponent that $$\log_{b}\left(M^n\right)=n\log_{b}\left(M\right)$$. In this case, $$M=x$$ and $$n=-2$$. This means that $$\ln(x^{\left(-2\right)})=-2ln(x)$$
We can use the power rule as follows. We know that the exponent that $$\log_{b}\left(M^n\right)=n\log_{b}\left(M\right)$$. In this case, $$M=x$$ and $$n=4$$. So, $$4ln(x)=\ln(x^4)$$
The first step is to identify the input values.
An input value is the first coordinate in an ordered pair.
There are no restrictions, since the ordered pairs are simply listed.
The domain is the first set of coordinates in the ordered pairs.
We cannot take the square root of a negative number, so the value inside the radical must be nonnegative.
What value does $$x$$ have to be greater than or equal to for $$x+4 \geq 0$$?
We know that $$f(-4)=0$$.
The function value increases as $$x$$ increases without any upper limit.
Therefore, we conclude that the range of f is $$[0,\infty)$$.
Two different formulas will be needed.
For $$n-values$$ under $$10$$, $$C=5n$$.
For values of $$n$$ that are $$10$$ or greater, $$C=50$$.
C(n) $$=$$ {5n if $$0<n<10$$, $$50$$ if $$n \geq 10$$}
First, we look to see which part of the domain our input falls in. Because $$1.5$$ is less than $$2$$, we use the first formula.
What is $$C(1.5)$$?
To find the cost of using $$4$$ gigabytes of data, C(4), we see that our input of $$4$$ is greater than $$2$$, so we use the second formula.
What is C(4)?
Identify the input values, or the first value in the coordinate

Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $$x$$. What is $$x$$?
When we exclude $$\frac{1}{2}$$ from the domain, what is the domain?
A square root function is undefined when the expression under the square root is negative. So, let's start by setting the expression under the sqare root to greater than or equal to zero. Then we know every value that makes this true is the domain of the function.
Set the value in the square root to being greater than or equal to $$0$$ and solve the inequality

Write this in interval notation, inclusive of the years, and we get [1950,2000].
What value is the lowest on the graph?
What value is the highest on the graph?
Write this in interval notation, inclusive of the number of endpoints, and we get [47,90].
Set the expression in the square root to greater than or equal to $$0$$ and solve for $$x$$. What does $$x$$ has to be less than or equal to?
Now, write $$x \leq 2$$ in interval notation, and we get $$(-\infty,2]$$.
When $$x$$ is $$2$$, we get the maximum value of this equation, which is $$-\sqrt{2-2}=0$$.
Therefore, the range of this function is less than or equal to $$0$$.
The expression $$y \leq 0$$ written in interval notation is $$(-\infty,0]$$.
Are there any restrictions on the values of $$x$$ in this cubic function?
If there are no restrictions, what is the domain?
The first step is to identify any restrictions on what $$x$$ can be by looking at the operations in the function.
In the function, first, $$x$$ is squared. Then, $$1$$ is subtracted from $$x^2$$. Are there any limitations on the value of $$x$$ for the function to have a valid output?
Any real number may be squared and then be lowered by one, so there are no restrictions on the domain of this function. The domain is the set of real numbers, negative infinity to $$\infty$$.
Are there any restrictions on the values of $$x$$ in this cubic function?
If there are no restrictions, what is the domain?
A square root function is undefined when the expression under the square root is negative. So, let's start by setting the expression under the sqare root to greater than or equal to zero. Then we know every value that makes this true is the domain of the function.

Solving for $$4-3x \geq 0$$, we get $$x \leq \frac{4}{3}$$.
The domain of the function is $$(-\infty,\frac{4}{3}]$$, with the square bracket around $$\frac{4}{3}$$ denoting the fact that $$\frac{4}{3}$$ is a valid solution.
A square root function is undefined when the expression under the square root is negative. So, let's start by setting the expression under the sqare root greater than or equal to zero. Then we know every value that makes this true is the domain of the function.
Since any integer squared is positive, and we are adding four to the squared number, there is no value of $$x$$ that makes the function undefined. So, the domain is $$(-\infty,\infty)$$.
Since cube roots are defined for positive, negative, and zero numbers, there are no values of $$x$$ that would make the function undefined. So, the domain is $$(-\infty,\infty)$$.
Since cube roots are defined for positive, negative, and zero numbers, there are no values of $$x$$ that would make the function undefined. So, the domain is $$(-\infty,\infty)$$.
A rational function is undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. So, let's start by setting the denominator equal to zero. Then we know every value other than that is a solution. (We can ignore the numerator since there is no value where it is undefined!)
What is $$x$$ for $$x-6=0$$?
So, the function is defined for every value other than 6.The domain of the function is $$(-\infty,6) \cup (6,\infty)$$, with the circle bracket around $$6$$ denoting the fact that $$6$$ is a not valid solution, and the U showing that both intervals are solutions.

What is $$x$$ for $$4x+2=0$$?
For $$4x+2=0$$, subtract $$2$$ from both sides, then divide both sides by $$4$$ to get $$x=\frac{-1}{2}$$.
So, the function is defined for every value other than -1/2.The domain of the function is $$(-\infty,\frac{-1}{2}) \cup (\frac{-1}{2},\infty)$$, with the circle bracket around $$\frac{-1}{2}$$ denoting the fact that $$\frac{-1}{2}$$ is a not valid solution, and the U showing that both intervals are solutions.
A rational function is undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. So, let's start by setting the denominator equal to zero. In addition, this function also contains a square root in the numerator which is undefined when the expression under the square root is negative, so we can set the numerator greater than or equal to zero.
What is $$x$$ for $$x-4=0$$?
What is $$x$$ for $$\sqrt{x+4} \geq 0$$?
So, the function is defined for every value greater than or equal to $$-4$$ other than 4.The domain of the function is $$[-4,4) \cup (4,\infty)$$, with the circle brackets denoting the fact that $$4$$ is not a valid solution, and the U showing that values within the intervals are solutions.
When there is a denominator, we want to include only values of the input that do not force the denominator to be zero. Therefore, the first step is to set the denominator to $$0$$ and solve for $$x$$.
$$2-x=0$$. $$x=$$?
Since the denominator is $$0$$ when $$x=2$$, $$2$$ is excluded from the domain.
The answers are all real numbers where $$x<2$$ or $$x>2$$ as shown in the image. We can use a symbol known as the union, U, to combine the two sets. In interval notation, we write the solution:(-inf, $$2) \cup (2,\infty)$$.\n##figure1.gif##

Now, we will exclude any number greater than $$7$$ from the domain. The answers are all real numbers less than or equal to $$7$$, or $$(-\infty,7]$$.
To describe the values, $$x$$, included in the intervals shown, we would say, “x is a real number greater than or equal to $$1$$ and less than or equal to $$3$$, or a real number greater than 5.”
The above statement, translated into inequality notations, is $$1 \leq x \leq 3$$ or $$x>5$$.

The range is [-4,0).
The input quantity along the horizontal axis is “years,” which we represent with the variable $$t$$ for time.
The graph may continue to the left and right beyond what is viewed, but based on the portion of the graph that is visible, we can determine the domain as $$1973 \leq t \leq 2008$$.
The output quantity is “thousands of barrels of oil per day,” which we represent with the variable $$b$$ for barrels.

There are no restrictions on the domain, as any real number may be cubed and then subtracted from the result.
The domain is $$(-\infty,\infty)$$.
Since there are no restrictions on the range, the range is $$(-\infty,\infty)$$.
We cannot evaluate the function at $$-1$$ because division by zero is undefined.
The domain $$is(-\infty,-1) \cup (-1,\infty)$$.
The function is never $$0$$, so we exclude $$0$$ from the range.
The range is $$(-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)$$.

When considering grade-point average as a function, the input values are percent grades, so the domain is the set of all integers between $$0$$ and $$100$$.
When considering grade-point average as a function, the output values are grade-point averages, so the range is {$$0.0$$, $$1.0$$, $$1.5$$, $$2.0$$, $$2.5$$, $$3.0$$, $$3.5$$, $$4.0$$.}
Because each input value in the domain leads to only one output value in the range, grade-point average is a function of the percent grade.
When considering area as a function of raidus, radius is the input values.
When considering area as a function of raidus, area is the output values.
The area formula of a circle is $$A=\pi r^2$$.
According to the formula $$A=\pi r^2$$, each $$r$$ can lead to only one particular A, so the area of a circle is a function of its radius.
A one-to-one function is a function in which each output value corresponds to exactly one input value. There are no repeated $$x-$$ or $$y-$$ values.
From step one, each $$r$$ corresponds to only one A.
When the area is A, the radius is $$\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}$$. So ecah A corresponds to exactly one $$r$$.
The domain is {a, c}.
The range is {b, $$d$$, c}.
Because the input value a leads to two different output values $$b$$ and c, the relation does not represent a function.
The domain is {a, $$b$$, c}.
The range is {b, c}.
Because each input value in the domain leads to only one output value in the range, the relation represents a function.

Given that we know $$a^2$$ and $$b^2$$, use the equation $$c^2=a^2-b^2$$ to determine the coordinates of the foci
The axes endpoints can be found with $$b$$ and a. $$a=9$$ and $$b=4$$ according to the equation. Since this is a horizontal ellipse, the major axes endpoints are $$(11,-1)$$ and $$(-7,-1)$$. The minor axes endpoints are $$(2,-5)$$ and $$(2,3)$$.
The foci endpoints can be found with c, which is equal to $$\sqrt{a^2-b^2}=\sqrt{65}$$. Since this is a horizontal ellipse, the foci are $$(2+\sqrt{65},-1)$$ and $$(2-\sqrt{65},-1)$$.
According to the equation, $$a=3$$ and $$b=2$$. This means that the major axes endpoints are: $$(-5,10),(-5,4)$$. The minor axes endpoints are: $$(-3,7),(-7,7)$$
Since $$a=3$$ and $$b=2$$, we can use $$c=\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$$ to get $$c=\sqrt{5}$$. This means that the foci are (-5,7+sqrt(5)),(-5,7-sqrt(5))
Since $$a=b$$, this is a circle of radius $$7$$. This means that there are no $$\frac{major}{minor}$$ axes or foci. DNE.
We know that $$a=36$$ and $$b=25$$. So, we can solve for c using the equation $$c=\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$$, leading to $$\sqrt{11}$$. So, the foci are (-3,-1-sqrt(11)),(-3,-1+sqrt(11))
Since we know that $$a=10$$ and $$b=2$$, we can solve for c using the equation $$c=\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$$, which gives us $$c=\sqrt{96}$$. Since this is a horizontal ellipse, the foci are (-1-sqrt(96),2),(-1+sqrt(96),2)

The area of an ellipse is given by $$a b \pi$$. Since $$a=\sqrt{5}$$ and $$b=2$$, the area of the ellipse is $$2\sqrt{5} \pi$$
We must put this equation into standard form in order to identify a and $$b$$. $$9\left(x^2-6x\right)+9\left(y^2-6y\right)=-81$$. $${9\left(x-3\right)}^2+{9\left(y-3\right)}^2=-81+81+81$$. $${\left(x-3\right)}^2+{\left(y-3\right)}^2=\frac{81}{9}$$. $${\left(x-3\right)}^2+{\left(y-3\right)}^2=9$$. $$\frac{{\left(x-3\right)}^2}{9}+\frac{{\left(y-3\right)}^2}{9}=1$$.
Since both a and $$b=3$$, we know this is a circle. The radius of the circle is $$3$$, so the area is $$9\pi$$

The first step is to interpret the problem. $$ \geq $$ means "greater or equal than," so we know the valid domain is all numbers greater than or equal to $$-3$$.
On a number line, shade to the right of $$3$$, and put a bracket at three. The answer should look like the image attached to this hint.\n##figure1.gif##
In interval notation, brackets are used when the left or right sides of the interval are included in the solution. For example, the expression $$"x \leq -1"$$ includes all numbers less than or equal to $$-1$$. Since $$-1$$ is included in the solution, the interval notation is $$(-\infty,-1]$$. Since $$\infty$$ represents "infinity" and is not an actual number, we always put a parenthesis next to $$\infty$$.

Now we have $$|-2x^2-3x+1| \leq 2{|x|}^2+3|x|+1$$. Think about how large $$|x|$$ can be.
Since $$x$$ is in $$(-2,3)$$, $$|x|<3$$
Substitute $$x=3$$ into $$2{|x|}^2+3|x|+1$$.
What is $$2{|3|}^2+3|3|+1$$
We can put $$3$$ inside the absolute value, which is $$|3\left(x-2\right)|$$
Two cases: $$3\left(x-2\right)$$ if $$x-2 \geq 0$$ and $$\left(-3\right) \left(x-2\right)$$ if $$x-2<0$$
Simplify: $$3x-6$$ if $$x \geq 2$$ and $$\left(-3\right) x+6$$ if $$x<2$$
Two cases: $$2x^3 x$$ if $$x \geq 0$$ and $$x^3 \left(-2x\right)$$ if $$x<0$$
Simplify: $$2x^4$$ if $$x \geq 0$$ and $$-2x^4$$ if $$x<0$$
Note we couldn't easily move $$x^3$$ into the absolute value, as it is sometimes positive and sometimes negative.
Note we can use the property that $$|a| |b|=|a b|$$
Can we change to $$|4\left(3x-6\right)|$$?
Under what condition we can remove the absolute value and change to $$4\left(3x-6\right)$$?

$$3x-6 \geq 0$$, then $$3x \geq 6$$, so $$x \geq 2$$, then $$3x<6$$, so $$x<2$$.

Note that the denominator cannot be $$0$$.
What value $$x$$ cannot equal if $$x-1 \neq 0$$?
We will discuss cases when $$2x-2>0$$ or $$2x-2<0$$, which is simplified to $$x>1$$ or $$x<1$$. The reason why we do not have $$x=1$$ is because $$x$$ cannot be $$1$$ as the denominator cannot be $$0$$.
If $$x>1$$, what should $$\frac{|2x-2|}{x-1}$$ be?
If $$x<1$$, what should $$\frac{|x-1|}{x-1}$$ be?

$$3$$ if $$x>-3$$ and $$-3$$ if $$x<-3$$
Note that for all $$y$$, $$|y| \geq 0$$ always.
Which one is correct? $$0>-1$$ or $$0<-1$$?
Since $$0>-1$$, it is impossible for $$|y|=-1$$ where $$y$$ can be any values.
Thus, does such an $$x$$ value exist in solving the equation?
Note that the denominator cannot be $$0$$.
What value $$x$$ cannot equal if $$x+2 \neq 0$$?
Note that $$|\frac{a}{b}|=\frac{|a|}{|b|}$$
Is $$|\frac{4}{x+2}|$$ equaled to $$\frac{|4|}{|x+2|}$$?
What is the value of $$|4|$$?
For $$x \neq -2$$, we have $$\frac{4}{|x+2|}<3$$, which means $$3|x+2|>4$$.
Here, we use the fact that for $$b>0$$, $$a<c$$, we can imply $$b a<b c$$
$$3|x+2|>4$$, so we have $$|x+2|>\frac{4}{3}$$ if we divide both side by $$3$$.
If $$x+2 \geq 0$$, what is $$|x+2|>\frac{4}{3}$$?
If $$x+2<0$$, what is $$|x+2|>\frac{4}{3}$$?
$$x+2>\frac{4}{3}$$, x>?
$$x+2<\frac{-4}{3}$$, x<?
Write $$x>\frac{-2}{3}$$ or $$x<\frac{-10}{3}$$ in interval notation. What is the answer?
Note $$x^2 \geq 0$$
Is $$x^2+1 \geq 0$$?
$$|x^2+1|$$ $$=x^2+1$$?
What does $$|\frac{4}{x^2+1}|$$ equal to?
For $$b>0$$, $$a>c$$, then $$b a>b c$$.
$$\frac{4}{x^2+1}>2$$ is equivalent to $$4>2\left(x^2+1\right)$$.
$$4>2\left(x^2+1\right)$$ is equivalent to $$x^2+1<2$$
$$x^2+1<2$$ is equivalent to $$x^2<1$$
Is $$x^2<1$$ equivalent to $${|x|}^2<1$$?
Is $${|x|}^2<1$$ equivalent to $$|x|<1$$?
For $$|x|<1$$, if $$x \geq 0$$, which one is correct?

Is $$|\frac{{\left(x+2\right)}^3}{2}|$$ equivalent to $$\frac{|{\left(x+2\right)}^3|}{|2|}$$?
Is $$\frac{|{\left(x+2\right)}^3|}{|2|}$$ equivalent to $$\frac{{|x+2|}^3}{2}$$?
Use the property $$|a b|=|a| |b|$$
$$|3x+6|=3|x+2|$$
Use the property $$|a b|=|a| |b|$$
Is there any value $$x$$ cannot be?
We now have $$\frac{{|x+2|}^3}{2}>3|x+2|$$
Multiply by $$2$$ on both sides, so we get $${|x+2|}^3>6|x+2|$$.
$${|x+2|}^3>6|x+2|$$ is equivalent to $${|x+2|}^2>6$$
For $$b>0$$, $$a b>c b$$ is equivalent to $$a>c$$.
$${|x+2|}^2>6$$ is equivalent to $$|x+2|>\sqrt{6}$$
For a,b>0, $$a>b$$ is equivalent to $$\sqrt{a}>\sqrt{b}$$.
$$|x+2|>\sqrt{6}$$ is equivalent to $$x+2>\sqrt{6}$$ or $$x+2<-\sqrt{6}$$
$$x+2>\sqrt{6}$$, x>?
$$x+2<\left(-\sqrt{6}\right)$$, x<?
Write $$x>\sqrt{6}-2$$ or $$x<-\sqrt{6}-2$$ in interval notation.
What is the answer in interval notation?

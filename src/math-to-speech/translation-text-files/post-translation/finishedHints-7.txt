Find the LCD.
What is the LCD?
Multiply each expression by the appropriate form of  1;  to obtain xy as the denominator for each fraction.
What is the first fraction?
What is the second fraction?
Now that the expressions have the same denominator, we simply add the numerators to find the sum.
What is the final fraction?
The first step is to find the least common denominator of two rational expressions.
What is the least common denominator?
Since we do not know the value of a, the least common multiple of the denominators is their product. So, the LCD is ; open paren a plus 1, close paren; times, open paren a minus 3, close paren; .
Now we need to multiply both expressions by a factor equal to ; 1  that makes the denominators equal to the LCD. Starting with the first expression, we can multiply , fraction, 4 over, a plus 1, end fraction;  by a factor to make the denominator ; open paren a plus 1, close paren; times, open paren a minus 3, close paren; .
The denominator of ; fraction, 4 over, a plus 1, end fraction;  multiplied by  a; plus; 3  equals ; open paren a plus 1, close paren; times, open paren a plus 3, close paren; . So, we need to multiply , fraction, 4 over, a plus 1, end fraction;  by ; fraction, a plus 3, over, a plus 3, end fraction; .
What is ; fraction, 4 over, a plus 1, end fraction; fraction, a minus 3, over, a minus 3, end fraction; ?
What is ; 4 times, open paren a minus 3, close paren; ?
When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. For the numerators, we can distribute the ; 4  into the  a, plus; 3  by adding  4 a  andadding it to  4 times negative 3, . The numerator then becomes 4a-12. After multiplying the denominators, we can leave the denominator as ; open paren a plus 1, close paren; times, open paren a minus 3, close paren;  since it is in its factored form. So, the new expression becomes ; fraction, 4 a minus 12, over, open paren a plus 1, close paren; times, open paren a minus 3, close paren, end fraction; .
Next, we need to multiply the second expression by a fraction to make the denominator equal to the LCD. Because the denominator of ; fraction, 5 over, a minus 3, end fraction;  needs to by multiplied by  a; plus; 1  to become ; open paren a plus 1, close paren; times, open paren a minus 3, close paren; , we need to , fraction, 5 over, a minus 3, end fraction;  by ; fraction, a plus 1, over, a plus 1, end fraction; .
What is ; fraction, 5 over, a minus 3, end fraction; fraction, a plus 1, over, a plus 1, end fraction; ?
We distribute the ; 5  into  a, plus 1  to get  5 a, plus 4; . Then, we leave the denominator in its factored form.
Because the expressions now have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the sum of the two expressions. We'll leave the denominator as it is, but combine the numerator's like terms.
What is , 5 a plus 4 a; ?
What is ; minus 12 plus 5; ?
Now we have our final expression: ; fraction, 9 a minus 7, over, open paren a plus 1, close paren; times, open paren a minus 3, close paren, end fraction; .
The first step is to find the least common denominator of two rational expressions.
What is the least common denominator?
Since we do not know the value of ; y , the least common multiple of the denominators is their product. So, the LCD is ; open paren y minus 2, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; .
Now we need to multiply both expressions by a factor equal to ; 1  that makes the denominators equal to the LCD. Starting with the first expression, we can multiply ; fraction, y plus 3, over, y plus 1, end fraction;  by a factor to make the denominator ; open paren y minus 2, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; .
The denominator of ; fraction, y plus 3, over, y minus 2, end fraction;  multiplied by  y; plus; 1  equals ; open paren y minus 2, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; . So, we need to multiply ; fraction, y plus 3, over, y plus 1, end fraction;  by ; open paren y plus 1, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; .
What is ; fraction, y plus 3, over, y minus 2, end fraction; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; ?
; open paren y plus 3, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; 
When multiplying polynomials, we need to use FOIL.
First, multiply the first value in each polynomial: ; y y is equal to, y squared . Next, multiply the outside values:  1 y; is equal to, y . Then, multiply the inside values:  3 y, is equal to, 3 y . Lastly, multiply the last values:  3 times 1; is equal to, 3 . Finally, combine like terms:  y, plus 3 y; is equal to; 4 y . So, the expression reads  y squared; plus 4 y plus 3; .
Next, we need to multiply the second expression by a fraction to make the denominator equal to the LCD. Because the denominator of ; fraction, y minus 3, over, y plus 1, end fraction;  needs to by multiplied by  y; minus; 2  to become ; open paren y minus 2, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; , we need to ; fraction, y minus 3, over, y plus 1, end fraction;  by ; open paren y minus 2, close paren; times, open paren y minus 2, close paren; .
What is ; fraction, y plus 3, over, y minus 2, end fraction; fraction, y plus 1, over, y plus 1, end fraction; ?
When multiplying polynomials, we need to use FOIL.
First, multiply the first value in each polynomial: ; y y is equal to, y squared . Next, multiply the outside values:  1 y; is equal to, y . Then, multiply the inside values:  3 y, is equal to, 3 y . Lastly, multiply the last values:  3 times 1; is equal to, 3 . Finally, combine like terms:  y, plus 3 y; is equal to; 4 y . So, the expression reads  y squared; plus 4 y plus 3; .
Because the expressions now have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the sum of the two expressions. We'll leave the denominator as it is, but combine the numerator's like terms.
What is ; y squared plus 4 y plus 3 minus y squared minus 5 y plus 6; ?
Combine the like terms: ; y squared minus y squared, is equal to 0; colon;   4 y, plus 5 y; is equal to 9 y; colon,   3 minus 6, is equal to negative 3; .
Now we have our final expression: ; fraction, 2 y squared, minus y plus 9, over, open paren y minus 2, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren, end fraction; .
Factoring is the process to split a product into a group of factors (a multiplication of simpler expressions).
Not all terms can be factored. Factor the terms that can be split further.
In this case, we can factor all the factors.
What does , 2 x squared, plus x minus 6;  factor into?
What does  x squared minus 1,  factor into?
What does  x squared minus 4,  factor into?
What does , x squared plus 2 x plus 1;  factor into?

What is the least common denominator?
Since we do not know the value of ; z , the least common multiple of the denominators is their product. So, the LCD is ; open paren z minus 2, close paren; times, open paren z plus 1, close paren; .
Now we need to multiply both expressions by a factor equal to ; 1  that makes the denominators equal to the LCD. Starting with the first expression, we can multiply ; fraction, 3 z, over, z plus 1, end fraction;  by a factor to make the denominator ; open paren z minus 2, close paren; times, open paren z plus 1, close paren; .
The denominator of ; fraction, 3 z, over, z minus 2, end fraction;  multiplied by  z; plus; 1  equals ; open paren z minus 2, close paren; times, open paren z plus 1, close paren; . So, we need to multiply ; fraction, 3 z, over, y plus 1, end fraction;  by ; fraction, z minus 2, over, z minus 2, end fraction; .
What is ; fraction, 3 z, over, z plus 1, end fraction; fraction, z minus 2, over, z minus 2, end fraction; ?

We need to distribute the ; 3 z  into the , open paren z minus 2, close paren; :  3 z z; is equal to; 3 z squared,  and , 3 z negative 2; is equal to; negative 6 z, . So, the numerator is ; fraction, 3 z squared, over, open paren z minus 2, close paren; times, open paren z plus 1, close paren, end fraction; . We can leave the denominator in its factored form.
Next, we need to multiply the second expression by a fraction to make the denominator equal to the LCD. Because the denominator of ; fraction, 2 z plus 5, over, z plus 1, end fraction;  needs to by multiplied by , open paren z minus 2, close paren;  to become ; open paren z minus 2, close paren; times, open paren z plus 1, close paren; , we need to ; fraction, 2 z plus 5, over, z plus 1, end fraction;  by ; fraction, z minus 2, over, z minus 2, end fraction; .

When multiplying polynomials, we need to use FOIL.
First, multiply the first value in each polynomial: ; 2 z z, is equal to; 2 z squared, . Next, multiply the outside values:  2 z times 1; is equal to, 2 z . Then, multiply the inside values:  5 z; is equal to, 5 z . Lastly, multiply the last values:  5 times 1; is equal to, 5 . Finally, combine like terms:  2 z, plus 5 z; is equal to; 7 z . So, the expression reads  2 z squared; plus 7 z plus 5; .
Because the expressions now have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the difference of the two expressions. We'll leave the denominator as it is, but combine the numerator's like terms.
What is ; 3 z squared, minus 6 z minus 2 z squared, plus 7 z plus 5; ?
Combine the like terms: ; 3 z squared, minus 2 z squared; is equal to; z squared   negative 6 z; minus 7 z; is equal to negative 13 z; colon   negative 6;  stays the same.
Now we have our final expression: ; fraction, z squared minus 13 z minus 6, over, open paren z minus 2, close paren; times, open paren z plus 1, close paren, end fraction; .
The first step is to find the least common denominator of two rational expressions.

Starting with the first expression, we can multiply , fraction, x over, x plus 1, end fraction;  by a factor to make the denominator ; open paren x plus 1, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; .
The denominator of ; fraction, x over, x plus 1, end fraction;  multiplied by  y; plus; 1  equals ; open paren x plus 1, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; . So, we need to multiply , fraction, x over, x plus 1, end fraction;  by ; fraction, y plus 1, over, y plus 1, end fraction; .
What is ; fraction, x over, x plus 1, end fraction; fraction, y plus 1, over, y plus 1, end fraction; ?
We can keep the denominator as it is, but distribute the ; x  into  y, plus 1 :  x y, plus x; .
Next, we need to multiply the second expression by a fraction to make the denominator equal to the LCD. Because the denominator of ; fraction, y over, y plus 1, end fraction;  needs to by multiplied by  x; plus; 1  to become ; open paren z plus 1, close paren; times, open paren y plus 1, close paren; , we need to , fraction, y over, y plus 1, end fraction;  by ; fraction, y plus 1, over, y plus 1, end fraction; .
What is ; fraction, y over, y plus 1, end fraction; fraction, x plus 1, over, x plus 1, end fraction; ?
Distribute the ; y  into  x, plus 1 :  x y; is equal to, x y  and  1 y; is equal to, y , so the expression reads  x y, plus y; .
Because the expressions now have the same denominator, we can add the numerators to get the sum of the two expressions. We'll leave the denominator as it is, but combine the numerator's like terms.
What is ; x y plus x plus x y plus y; ?
Combine the like terms: ; x y plus x y; is equal to, 2 x y; colon  the  x  and  y;  stay the same.

Create a table to organize the information where the columns indicate the type of coin and the rows include the number of coins, their value, and their total value when multiplied. We can work this problem all in cents or in dollars. Here we'll do it in dollars and put in the dollar sign in the tail as a reminder. The value of a dime is ; dollars 0.10,  and the value of a nickel is  dollars 0.05, . The total value of all the coins is  dollars 2.05; .
Choose a variable to represent the quantity for which we are looking for. So, let ; n is equal to, number  of nickels.  n, plus 7; is equal to number;  of dimes.
To get the total value of each type of coin, we can use the relationship: total value of a , type is equal to, number  of coins of this  typevalue;  of this type.
We know that value of ; dimes plus value  of  nickels; is equal to; total  value of coins. Plug in the numbers and variables, we get the equation , 0.1 of, open paren n plus 7, close paren; plus 0.05 n; is equal to 2.05; .
To solve ; 0.1 of, open paren n plus 7, close paren; plus 0.05 n; is equal to, 2.05 , we follow the following steps: 0.10n+0.10*7+0.05n=2.05-->0.15n=1.35-->n=9. Therefore, the number of nickels is  9 , and the number of dimes is  9; plus 7; is equal to 16; .
Make sure all the word and ideas are understood. Determine the types of coins involved. Think about the strategy we used to find the value of the handful of coins. The first thing we need is to notice what type of coins are involved. Liliana has nickels and quarters. Create a table to organize the information where the columns indicate the type of coin and the rows include the number of coins, their value, and their total value when multiplied. We can work this problem all in cents or in dollars. Here we'll do it in dollars and put in the dollar sign in the tail as a reminder. The value of a quarter is ; dollars 0.25,  and the value of a nickel is  dollars 0.05, . The total value of all the coins is  dollars 2.10; .
Choose a variable to represent the quantity for which we are looking for. So, let ; q is equal to, number  of quarters.  q, plus 12; is equal to number;  of nickels.
To get the total value of each type of coin, we can use the relationship: total value of a , type is equal to, number  of coins of this  typevalue;  of this type.
We know that value of ; quarters plus value  of  nickels; is equal to; total  value of coins. Plug in the numbers and variables, we get the equation  0.25 q, plus, 0.05 of, open paren q plus 12, close paren; is equal to 2.10; .
To solve ; 0.25 q plus, 0.05 of, open paren q plus 12, close paren; is equal to, 2.10 , we follow the following steps: 0.25q+0.05q+0.05*12=2.10-->0.3q=1.5-->q-5. Therefore, the number of quarters is  5 , and the number of nickels is  5; plus 12; is equal to 17; .

First, augument the matrix with the first two columns. In other words, duplicate the first two columns, and add them to the end of the matrix.
Now, follow the formula to find the determinant. First, multiply the entries down from the row ; 1  column one spot, to the row  3  column  3  spot, in a diagonal fashion. Do this for the next two diagonals as well, from the row  1  column  2  spot, to the row  3  column  4  spot, and from the row  1  column  3  spot to the row  3  column  5;  spot.
Now, add all the previous products together. What do you get as your answer?
Next, multiply the values from the bottom left of the matrix to the location  3  spots to the top in a diagonal. Another way to see this is a diagonal from the bottom to the top. Do this for the next  2;  columns.
Now, subtract all the values that were just multiplied from the first set of diagonal multiplications(those that you calculated previously).
Therefore, the determinant is  1 over 480; .

We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "b" would be 0.05s+1,200=2,840. We now isolate the variable "s" and get ; 0.05 s is equal to, 1640 . Then, we can divide both sides by  0.05  to get  s; is equal to 32800; .
After solving for "s", we can plug that value into the first equation to get 32,800+b=40,000 which we can determine  b  to be 7,200.
Let's use "b" as bank loan and "f" as the federal loan. The total amount of money combined is $21,540, therefore we can determine that the first equation is , b plus f, is equal to 21540; 
Because the total amount is how much she paid ; times; open paren, dollars 1 comma 669.68; close paren;  and there is an interest rate of  10.5 percent  from bank and  5.9 percent  from federal, we can determine that the second equation is  0.105 b; plus 0.059 f; is equal to 1; comma 669.68;

Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is , 300 , therefore we can determine that the first equation is  a, plus c; is equal to 300; 
Because the total amount of money made was $17,200 and adult tickets are $70 and childrens $50 we can determine that the second equation is ; 70 a plus 50 c; is equal to 17200; 
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get , c is equal to 300 minus a; 
We can plug in ; c is equal to; 300 minus, a  using the second equation to get  70 a, plus, 50 of, open paren 300 minus a, close paren; is equal to 17200; 
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be ; 20 a plus 600, is equal to, 17200 . We now isolate the variable "a" and get  20 a; is equal to, 16600 . Then, we can divide both sides by  20  to get  a; is equal to 83; .
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get ; 83 plus c, is equal to, 300  which we can determine "c" to be  217; .
Let's use "a" as the number of adult tickets and "c" as the number of childrens tickets. The total number of tickets combined is , 72 , therefore we can determine that the first equation is  a, plus c, is equal to 72; 
Because the total amount of money made was $1,200 and adult tickets are $22 and childrens $10 we can determine that the second equation is ; 22 a plus 10 c; is equal to 1200; 
Let's use the first equation to isolate c. With the equation, we can subtract a from both sides to get , c is equal to 72 minus a; 
We can plug in ; c is equal to; 72 minus, a  using the second equation to get  22 a, plus, 10 of, open paren 72 minus a, close paren; is equal to 1200; 
We can determine that the second equation after plugging in "c" would be ; 12 a plus 720, is equal to, 1200 . We now isolate the variable "a" and get  12 a, is equal to, 480 . Then, we can divide both sides by  12  to get  a; is equal to 40; .
After solving for "a", we can plug that value into the first equation to get , 40 plus c, is equal to 72  which we can determine "c" to be  32; .

To do this, we can use the dimensions of the tower to find some point (x,y) that lies on the hyperbola. We will use the top right corner of the tower to represent that point. Since the y-axis bisects the tower, our x-value can be represented by the radius of the top, or  30  meters. The y-value is represented by the distance from the origin to the top, which is given as  67.082  meters. We can thus substitute , open paren, 30 comma 67.082, close paren;  and  a; is equal to 20  into our equation to solve for  b; .
We want to isolate ; b  in the standard form , fraction, x squared, over, a squared, end fraction; minus, fraction, y squared, over, b squared, end fraction; is equal to, 1 . Isolating  b , what is the algebraic expression that  b;  is equals to?
Having found an expression for ; b , we now substitute in  x, is equal to 20 ,  y, is equal to, 67.082  and  a, is equal to 20  as previously explained. What is  b; ? Round to four decimal places.
Having found a and ; b , we can now substitute them into the standard form equation , fraction, x squared, over, a squared, end fraction; minus, fraction, y squared, over, b squared, end fraction; is equal to 1; 
The standard form for hyperbola is either ; fraction, open paren x minus h, close paren squared, over, a squared, end fraction; minus; fraction, open paren y minus k, close paren squared, over, b squared, end fraction; is equal to; 1 \nor ; fraction, open paren y minus k, close paren squared, over, a squared, end fraction; minus; fraction, open paren x minus h, close paren squared, over, b squared, end fraction; is equal to 1;  depending on the transverse axis.
Observe that only one of the variables, , y , is of degree  2 , while  x  is of degree  1; . Thus, this is a parabola.
We want to apply the slicing method to a pyramid with a square base. To set up the integral, consider figure (a) the pyramid shown in the figure, oriented along the x-axis, and figure (b) a two-dimentional view of the pyramid from the side.\n##figure1.gif##
First, determine the shape of a cross-section of the pyramid. Since the base is a square, the cross-sections will also be squares.
Next, determine a formula for the area of one of the cross-sectional squares. Looking at figure (b), and using a proportion, since these are similar triangles, we have , s over a, is equal to x over h; .

(b) Revolving the region about the line  y; is equal to negative 2;  generates a solid of revolution with a cylindrical hole through its middle.\n##figure1.gif##
We cannot apply the formula to this problem directly because the axis of revolution is not one of the coordinate axes. However, we still know that the area of the cross-section is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. Looking at the graph of the function, we see the radius of the outer circle is given by , f of x plus 2, .

We have enough information to figure out the vertical dimensions-- the height-- of the parallelogram. We know that the parallelogram is bounded by ; g of x is equal to, 2  and the  x  axis, so the height is  2; .
We can figure out the horizontal dimensions by first finding the equation of the line that passes through ; times, open paren 6 comma 1, close paren; , then finding its  x  values when  y  ; is equal to,   0  (meaning it intersects the  x  axis) and when it intersects  g of x; is equal to 2; .
We know that the line passing through ; times, open paren 6 comma 1, close paren;  is parallel to  f of x; is equal to, 3 x . What this means is that the line we want to find also has a slope of  3 . Since we know the slope of the line and a point on the line, we can plug this into the equation  y; is equal to; m x plus; b  to find  b . We know that the point , open paren 6 comma 1, close paren;  means  y; is equal to 1  and  x, is equal to, 6 , and the slope,  m , is  3 . Thus,  1; is equal to; 3 times 6 plus, b . Solving for  b , we get that  b; is equal to, negative 17 . Therefore, the equation of the line is  3 x; minus 17; .
Using the equation of the line ; y is equal to, 3 x minus 17 , when  y; is equal to 0 , what is  x; ?
Using the equation of the line ; y is equal to, 3 x minus 17 , when  y; is equal to 2 , what is  x; ?
We now know that the horizontal base of the paralleogram is starts at ; x is equal to, 17 thirds  and ends at  y, is equal to; 19 thirds . We can find the length of the base by subtracting  17 thirds  from  19 thirds , which gives us  2 thirds; .

Input  12  as the  x,  value. Then, calculate the equation using that value.
, 75000 plus 2500 times 12; is equal to; ?
The first step is to identity the changing quantities. From the problem, we can see that the year town populations change, so our variables are "time" and "population."
The next step is to define input and output. Our input is "time," and our output is "population." To make the input nicer, instead of defining time with the year number, we will let time, represented by the variable ; t , be equal to the number of years after  2004 . Thus, in  2004 ,  t  ; is equal to   0; . Our output is P(t), which represents population as a function of time.
We need to determine the rate of change-- that is, the change in output over the change in input. This is equivalent to the slope of the linear model, which is constant by the definition of linearity (a line.)
In ; 2004 ,  t  , is equal to,   0  and P(t) , is equal to;   6200 . We can represent this with the coordinate point , open paren 0 comma 6200, close paren; . In  2009 ,  t  ; is equal to,   5  (since  2009, minus 2004; is equal to 5; close paren;  and P(t) ; is equal to;   8100 , giving us the point , open paren 5 comma 8100, close paren; . The slope,  m , is calculated as the change in  y  over the change in  x; .
What is  8100 minus 6200, ?
What is  5 minus 0, ?
What is  1900 over 5, ?
We have determined that the slope is ; 380   people over year;  (since we dividing the change in  y , which was in units of people, by the change in  x , which was in units of years.) For the equation of the line, we need to know the y-intercept, which occurs when  t  ; is equal to   0; .
When ; t is equal to, 0 ,   cap p of t; is equal to; ?
The slope is ; 380  and the  y  intercept is  6200 , so we know the line  y  ; is equal to;  mx +  b , with  y  being P(t),  x  being  t ,  m  being slope, and  b  being the y-intercept, is   cap p of t; is equal to, 380 t plus 6200; .
To predict the population in ; 2013 , we find the value of P(t) when  t  , is equal to,   9  (Since  2013, minus 2004; is equal to 9; close paren; .
When ; t   is equal to,   9 , and   cap p of t; is equal to, 380 t plus 6200; , what is the value of P(9)?
We are given that the population, P(t), is equal to ; 15000 , so now we need to solve for  t . Using the equation obtained in part a, we get that  15000; is equal to, 380 t plus 6200; .
; 15000 is equal to; 380 t plus 6200 , so  15000, minus 6200; is equal to, 380 t .  t;  is equal to about?
The first step is to identify the changing variables and assigning them to input and output. Our input will be  t; , time in hours, and our output will be A(t), distance in miles, and E(t), distance in miles.
Because it is not obvious how to define our output variable, we’ll start by drawing a picture such as in the image attached to this hint.\n##figure1.gif##
They both start at the same intersection so when , t is equal to, 0 , the distance traveled by each person should also be  0 . Thus the initial value for each is  0; .
Anna is walking , 4  miles per hour and Emanuel is walking  3  miles per hour, which are both rates of change. The slope for A is  4  and the slope for E is  3; .
For this problem, the distances from the starting point are important. To notate these, we can define a coordinate system, identifying the “starting point” at the intersection where they both started. Then we can use the variable, A, which we introduced above, to represent Anna’s position, and define it to be a measurement from the starting point in the eastward direction. Likewise, can use the variable, E, to represent Emanuel’s position, measured from the starting point in the southward direction. Note that in defining the coordinate system, we specified both the starting point of the measurement and the direction of measure.
We can then define a third variable, D, to be the measurement of the distance between Anna and Emanuel. Showing the variables on the diagram is often helpful, as we can see from the attached image. Recall that we need to know how long it takes for D, the distance between them, to equal  2;  miles. Notice that for any given input 𝑡, the outputs A(t), E(t), and D(t) represent distances.\n##figure2.gif##

;  cap d of t, is equal to 5 t; colon;  this means that the distance between Anna and Emanuel is also a linear function. Because D is a linear function, we can now answer the question of when the distance between them will reach  2  miles. We will set the output   cap d of t; is equal to, 2  cap d of t, is equal to 2  and solve for  t; .
;  cap d of t, is equal to, 5 t , so  5 t; is equal to 2 .  t, is equal to; ?
It might help here to draw a picture of the situation. See the attached image. It would then be helpful to introduce a coordinate system. While we could place the origin anywhere, placing it at Westborough seems convenient. This puts Agritown at coordinates ; open paren 30 comma 10, close paren; comma; open paren 30 comma 10, close paren; , and Eastborough at , open paren 20 comma 0, close paren; .
Using the point ; times, open paren 30 comma 10, close paren; , we can find the slope of the line from Westborough to Agritown. Slope ; is equal to,  Change in  y over Change,  in  x  ; is equal to;  ; fraction, 30 minus 0, over, 10 minus 0, end fraction; is equal to 3; .
Now we can write an equation to describe the road from Westborough to Agritown, ;  cap w of x, is equal to, 1 third x . From this, we can determine the perpendicular road to Eastborough will have slope  m, is equal to; negative 3 . Because the town of Eastborough is at the point , open paren 20 comma 0, close paren; , we can find the equation.
;  cap e of x, is equal to, negative 3 x, plus b . When  x; is equal to 20 ,  b, is equal to; ?
We can now find the coordinates of the junction of the roads by finding the intersection of these lines. Setting them equal, ; 1 third x, is equal to, negative 3 x, plus 60; .
; 1 third x, is equal to, negative 3 x, plus 60 ,  x; is equal to; ?
Next, subsitute ; x is equal to 18  back into the original equation.  y, is equal to  cap w of 18, is equal to, fraction, 1 over, 3 times 18, end fraction; .
; y is equal to; fraction, 1 over, 3 times 18, end fraction; ,  y; is equal to; ?
Thus, the roads intersect at , open paren 18 comma 6, close paren; . Using the distance formula, we can now find the distance from Westborough to the junction.
The first step is to indentify input and output. The input is  d , distance driven in miles: the outputs are K(d): cost, in dollars, for renting from Keep on Trucking, and M(d): cost, in dollars, for renting from Move It Your Way.
The initial value is the up-front fee: ;  cap k of 0, is equal to, 20  and   cap m of 0; is equal to 16; colon;  the rates of change are   cap k of d, is equal to, dollars 0.59,  /mile and   cap p of d; is equal to, dollars 0.63;  /mile.
A linear function is of the form ; f of x is equal to; m x plus, b . Using the rates of change and initial charges, we can write the equations   cap k of d; is equal to; 0.59 d plus, 20  and   cap m of d; is equal to, 0.63 d plus 16; .
Using these equations, we can determine when Keep on Trucking, Inc., will be the better choice. Because all we have to make that decision from is the costs, we are looking for when Move It Your Way, will cost less, or when ,  cap k of d, is less than  cap m of d; . The solution pathway will lead us to find the equations for the two functions, find the intersection, and then see where the K(d) function is smaller. The attached image shows the graph of the two functions, with K(d) in blue.\n##figure1.gif##
To find the intersection, we set the equations equal and solve. ;  cap k of d, is equal to;  cap m of d , so  0.59 d; plus 20; is equal to, 0.63 d plus 16; .
; 0.59 d plus 20, is equal to, 0.63 d plus 16 ,  d; is equal to; ?
The value of ; d  tells us that the cost from the two companies will be the same if  100  miles are driven. Either by looking at the graph, or noting that K(d) is growing at a slower rate, we can conclude that Keep on Trucking, Inc. will be the cheaper price when more than  100  miles are driven, that is  d; is greater than 100; .
The first step is to identify the input and output of the equation.
The input is donuts,  x , and the output is cost, c.
The initial value is the fixed cost of  25000 .
The rate of change is the value of change in output over change in input. We know that the rate of change is , 0.25  because it takes  0.25,  units of output to produce a single unit of input, a donut.
The equation of a linear model is ; y is equal to; m x plus, b , where  y  is the output,  x  is the input,  m  is the rate of change, and  b;  is the initial value. Plug in the values we have found to obtain the final answer.
The y-intercept is the value of the output when the value of the input is ; 0 . Using the equation we derived in part a, when  x, is equal to, 0 ,   cap c, is equal to 25000; .

The first step is to build a linear model. For simplicity, we will define the input as years from ; 2008 , and the output as population. The initial value is  28200  and the rate of change is ; fraction, 36800 minus 28200, over, 4 minus 0, end fraction; , or the change in output over the change in input.
What is ; fraction, 36800 minus 28200, over, 4 minus 0, end fraction; ?
The rate of change is ; 2150   people over year; , so the equation is   cap p of t; is equal to; 2150 t plus, 28200 , where  t  is years since  2008;  and P(t) is the population.
;  cap p of t, is equal to; 2150 t plus, 28200  when  t  ; is equal to;   6  (since  2014  is  6  years after 2008),   cap p of 6; is equal to; ?
Solve for ; t  when   cap p of t; is equal to, 54000 .  54000, is equal to, 2150 t plus 28200 ,  t; is equal to; ?
Graphing the problem is useful to understand the geometry we are working with. First, label a point T to represent the town of Timpson. We know that Ashburn is ; 60  miles east and  12  miles north of Timpson, so indicate a point A for Ashburn  60  units right of Timpson and  12  units up. This can be done by setting point T at the origin, , open paren 0 comma 0, close paren; , and setting point A at , open paren 60 comma 12, close paren; . We know that Garrison is perpendicular to the line connecting , open paren 0 comma 0, close paren;  and , open paren 60 comma 12, close paren; , based on the problem's given information. We can label Garrison as point G, at , open paren 20 comma 0, close paren;  to represent being  20  units east of point T. From the graph, we can tell that we are trying to find the point of the intersection between the line perpendicular to the line connecting T and A, that also goes through , open paren 20 comma 0, close paren; .
The slope of the line between A and T is , 60 over 12, is equal to 5, .
The slope of the perpendicular line is ; fraction, negative 1, over 5, end fraction; .  0; is equal to; 20, fraction, negative 1, over 5, end fraction; plus b , so  b; is equal to 4 . The line is  y, is equal to; fraction, negative 1, over 5, end fraction; x; plus 4; .
; fraction, negative 1, over 5, end fraction; x; plus 4; is equal to, 5 x ,  x, is equal to; ?
; x is equal to, 10 over 13, ,  f of 10 over 13; is equal to; ?
; the square root of open paren 50 over 13, close paren squared; plus, open paren 10 over 13, close paren squared end root; is equal to; ?
We have enough information to figure out the length of the horizontal base. We know that the parallelogram is bounded by ; x is equal to, 0  (the  y  axis) and  x; is equal to 3 , so it is  3;  units wide.
(It is useful to graph the information to better understand the geometry involved.) To find the vertical dimensions, first find the equation of the line that passes through ; times, open paren 2 comma 7, close paren; . Then, see where it intersects the  y  axis, and alsto where f(x) intersects the  y  axis. Parallelograms have equal vertical bases, so the difference in the  y;  coordinates will be the length of the vertical base.
We know that the line passing through ; times, open paren 2 comma 7, close paren;  is parallel to  f of x; is equal to; 1 plus, 2 x . What this means is that the line we want to find also has a slope of  2 . Since we know the slope of the line and a point on the line, we can plug this into the equation  y; is equal to; m x plus; b  to find  b . We know that the point , open paren 2 comma 7, close paren;  means  y; is equal to 7  and  x, is equal to, 2 , and the slope,  m , is  2 . Thus,  7; is equal to; 2 times 2 plus, b . Solving for  b , we get that  b; is equal to, 3 . Therefore, the equation of the line is  2 x, plus 3; .
Next, we can find where this line intersects the ; y  axis. At the  y  axis,  x; is equal to, 0 , so plug in  0  to the equation. When  x; is equal to 0 ,  y, is equal to, 2 times 0 plus 3, is equal to; 3 . Thus, the coordinate point of one of the vertices is , open paren 0 comma 3, close paren; .
We can then find where f(x) intersects the ; y  axis. Plugging in  x, is equal to, 0 , we get  f of 0, is equal to; 1 . Thus, the other vertice that we are looking for is , open paren 0 comma 1, close paren; .
The difference of the ; y  coordinates of the two points we have found is  3, minus 1, is equal to 3 . Thus, the vertical base has a length of  2; .

The area formula for a triangle is , 1 half b h, , where  b  is the base and  h;  is the height.
First draw, a diagram. By graphing f(x) and the line perpendicular to it, we can tell that the height of the triangle is equal to the y-coordinate of the intersection between f(x) and the perpendicular line. We can also see that the horizontal base of the triangle is the distance from ; times, open paren 0 comma 0, close paren;  to the point where f(x) intersects the  x;  axis.
The first step is to figure out the equation of the perpendicular line. Because it is perpendicular to ; f of x is equal to, 12 minus 1 third x; , we know that its slope is equal to the opposite reciprocal of the slope of f(x).
What is the opposite reciprocal of , fraction, negative 1, over 3, end fraction; ? This is equal to the slope of the perpendicular line to f(x).

The area formula for a triangle is , 1 half b h, , where  b  is the base and  h;  is the height.
First draw, a diagram. By graphing f(x) and the line perpendicular to it, we can tell that the height of the triangle is equal to the y-coordinate of the intersection between f(x) and the perpendicular line. We can also see that the horizontal base of the triangle is the distance from ; times, open paren 0 comma 0, close paren;  to the point where f(x) intersects the  x;  axis.
The first step is to figure out the equation of the perpendicular line. Because it is perpendicular to ; f of x is equal to, 9 minus 6 sevenths x; , we know that its slope is equal to the opposite reciprocal of the slope of f(x).
What is the opposite reciprocal of , fraction, negative 6, over 7, end fraction; ? This is equal to the slope of the perpendicular line to f(x).
At what ; x  value does  7 sixths x; is equal to, 9 minus 6 sevenths x; ?
When ; x is equal to; 85 over 42, , , f of, open paren 85 over 42, close paren; is equal to; ?
Through graphing, we know that the y-coordinate of the intersection is the height of the triangle, and the intersection has coordinates ; open paren, 85 over 42, comma 356 over 49; close paren; . Thus, the height of the triangle is  356 over 49; .
When ; y is equal to, 0 , f(x) intersects the  x  axis. Plug in  y; is equal to, 0  to the equation for f(x). What is  x  equal to when  y; is equal to 0; ?

There are two types of sampling that divide the population into groups of people: stratified and cluster. The differences between the two are that stratified sampling takes a proportionate number of subjects from each stratum to include into the sample while clustering usually means only a few clusters are selected to represent the entire population.
Does this soccer coach want to pick players from each group that he's created based on age? Or does he only want one or two groups to be represented. If the soccer coach wants people from each age group to be included in the recreational team, select stratified. If the coach only wants one or two groups to be represented, select cluster.

Note that librarian records the data for every fourth patron who checks out books.We see that this is a methodology that is not based on convenience (the librarian doesn't just pick the most easily available data points). Therefore, it must either be systematic or simple random from process of elimination. The definition of a systematic sample is randomly selecting a starting point and take the nth piece of data from the population. The definition of simple random sampling is fairly selecting a group of size  n  from the population so every individual has the same chance of being selected. Which one sounds the most like the librarian's selection method?

The high school educational researcher wants to interview  50  high school female teachers and  50,  high school male teachers. Therefore, you know that the two separate groups are high school female teachers and high school male teachers. To decide whether this is stratified or cluster sampling, we must think about whether every group is represented in the sample. Choose STRATIFIED if a proportion of each separate group is included in the final sample: choose CLUSTER if not all the groups are included in the final sample, but every member of the selected groups is included.

For four df and alpha ; is equal to;   0.05 , the LinRegTTest gives  p, minus value  ; is equal to   0.2288;  so we do not reject the null hypothesis:
Since we do not reject the null hypothesis, there is not a significant linear relationship between deaths and age.
, p minus value  is greater than  0.05; .
Since , p minus value  is more than  0.05; , there is not a linear relationship between the two variables,

Substitute ŷ ; is equal to,   0  and solve for  x . We end up getting  x  ; is equal to;  1,125
We don’t know if the pre-1981 data was collected from a single year.
So we don’t have an accurate , x  value for this figure.Regression equation: ŷ (#Flu Cases)  is equal to  -3,448,225 +  1749.777;  (year)
Use the given equation and substitute , x   is equal to   1985; 
Use the given equation and substitute , x   is equal to   1990; 
The range of , x  values was  1981  to 2002: the year  1970;  is not in this range.
The regression equation does not apply, because predicting for the year  1970;  is extrapolation, which requires a different process. Also, a negative number does not make sense in this context, where we are predicting flu cases diagnosed.
The data support that the melting point for Alloy Zeta is different from the melting point of Alloy Gamma.

We can eliminate ; x  to add the first two equations to get  y, plus 2 z; is equal to; 3 . We must however, find another equation without  x  in it. To do this, we must multiply equation  1  by  negative 2  and add the result to equation  3 . This will result in the equation  negative y; minus z; is equal to negative 1; .
We can solve for ; z  by adding the two equations derived in the previous step:  y, plus 2 z; is equal to, 3  and  negative y, minus z; is equal to, negative 1 . The sum is  z, is equal to; 2 . We can now back-substitute  z  into  y, plus 2 z; is equal to 3  to get  y, is equal to; negative 1 .

To solve this problem, we use all of the information given and set up three equations. First, we assign a variable to each of the three investment amounts: ; x is equal to, mone y sub market,  fund,  y; is equal to, municipal  bonds,  z, is equal to; mutual  funds. With these variables, we can create the three following equations based on the information given in the word problem: x+y+z=12000,z=y+4000,0.03x+0.04y+0.07z=670. These three equations make a system. To make the caculations easier, the last equation can be multipled by  100 , giving us  3 x; plus 4 y plus 7 z; is equal to 67000; 
To solve this equation, we must first multiply equation ; 1  by  negative 3 , giving us  y; plus 4 z; is equal to, 31000 . We can now add equation  2  to that derived in the eprevious step to give us  5 z; is equal to, 35000 ,  z, is equal to; 7000 . With  z , we can solve for y: we plug back in to equation  2  and solve for  y .  negative y; plus 7000; is equal to 4000; comma; y is equal to; 3000 . Finally, we plug  z  and  y  into equation  1  to get  x; plus 3000 plus 7000; is equal to, 12000 , leading to  x, is equal to 2000; . Thus, we have the soluttion nas (2000,3000,7000)

Equation ; 4  can be multiplied by  2  and added to equation  5  to try and solve for  z . However, this leads to both variables  z  and  y  to be cancelled out, leading to the equation  0; is equal to 2; . Since this is false, the system is inconsistent.
To eliminate ; x , multiply the first equation by  negative 2  and add the result to the third equation. We get  negative y; plus 3 z; is equal to, negative 4 . If we add this to the second equation, we get  0, is equal to negative 3; , which is false. So, the system is inconsistent.
First, we can multiply equation ; 1  by  negative 2  and add it to equation  2 , but this gives us  0; is equal to 0;  which is always true. S
This means that we must find the general solution, or the solution in terms of ; x . Add equations  1  and  2  to get  3 x; minus 2 z; is equal to 0 .  z, is equal to; 3 halves x, .

Multiply the first equation by ; minus, 3  and add the result to the second equation. This gives us  negative 5 y; minus 4 z; is equal to; negative 17 . Now, multiply thee first equation by  negative 1  and add to the third equation to get  5 y; plus 4 z; is equal to 17 . Add these two equations together to get  0, is equal to 0; .
